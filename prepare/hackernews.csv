,,"The worst case for kickstarter is that they fall under both consumer protection laws and investment regulations.<p>There is no question that they fall under consumer protection laws, products are being advertised and offered, and anyone can ""buy"" them. I'm sure the FTC already has an open investigation or investigations.<p>If you create a kickstarter project, pull in $1m+, spend it all legitimately and fail to deliver the project, you could end up being named in a civil suit. In the future there will be people who lose their houses over this. Just because you made the project in 2011 doesn't mean you won't get sued in 2014.<p>If you create a kickstarter project, pull in $1m+, spend it all illegitimately, on personal expenses, expect to go to jail. I predict this will happen to at least 1 person.<p>The larger question to me is what liability kickstarter themselves have. Whatever that amount ends up being, I think they can absorb it as a cost of doing business, as long as it remains on the civil side of the law.<p>I like kickstarter. So far I've stuck to using it for pen and paper RPGs, something I know can be delivered on. I think the core concept around kickstarter is going to radically change the world of consumer products.

2.

,,"The shutter speed and frame rate are not necessarily linked. Unless you’re using an ND filter (or an undesirably high f-stop) specifically because you want to be able to have more motion blur, most well-lit scenes would surely be blown out at 1&#x2F;24 of a second (or the usual 1&#x2F;48 or 1&#x2F;60), even at the lowest ISO, so digital cameras compensate by shooting individual frames at higher shutter speeds, reducing or eliminating motion blur anyways.<p>Under optimal conditions, maybe you’re right… but I would personally lump the desire for tons of motion blur in with the nostalgia that causes people to use 24 fps in the first place.<p>It’s not like people originally <i>wanted</i> to shoot at a noticeably low frame rates… it’s just what they had to do. Then it became a standard that resisted change. Now people artificially restrict themselves to be bug-for-bug compatible with old technology. In fact, a lot of silent films were shot at 16 fps. Why does no one clamor for the return of 16 fps? Arguably, 16 fps is 33% more cinematic!<p>There are plenty of reasons that I’m not a professional cinematographer… but for the same reason that no one would prefer to watch a film captured in 10 fps, it follows logically that 24 fps is not <i>actually</i> “better” than higher frame rates. It’s just what people have been taught to see as better through experience when they contrast traditional, high budget films shot at 24 fps with low budget TV shows that were broadcast at 60 fps. It’s probably going to be decades before people unlearn this low frame rate preference, but I predict people a hundred years from now will be <i>far</i> less impressed with 24 fps footage than some people today.<p>I have plenty of other unpopular opinions available too. :P<p>Regardless, it doesn’t seem beyond belief to imagine that someone could combine the 5 frames of 120fps -&gt; 24fps into individual “long exposure” shots that produce a similar motion blur effect as a single frame taken with a slower shutter. The necessary data is (mostly) all there, if someone took advantage of it. A well-proven technique similar to this is used in astrophotography to create artificially longer exposures, but it is combined with an alignment step to <i>avoid</i> the motion blur of the Earth spinning relative to the stars, which is why astrophotographers don&#x27;t just extend the length of the exposure, and why they bother with combining multiple exposures. Obviously, applying this technique to <i>create</i> motion blur would mean skipping the alignment step, at a minimum, but this is probably one of those things that would be relatively simple for a properly trained neural network to do a good job with smoothing out, to avoid the gaps of motion blur between the frames that are available... each of which would likely be individually shot with a shutter speed faster than 1&#x2F;120 anyways.",,coder543,,1633277034,2021-10-03T16:03:54Z,comment,28738182,28738120,,,

,,"Electrical aviation is starting to look like a serious business opportunity; especially for short haul. The premise is very similar to electrical cars: they are a lot simpler to manufacture, the electricity is comparatively cheap (and getting cheaper), the maintenance cost is much lower, and they are a lot simpler and cheaper to operate.<p>I see a lot of articles pointing out that this does not scale to large aircraft due to various physical constraints. This is both true and irrelevant. The only reason large aircraft exist is that they make better use of a very expensive resource: fuel. Because of their size, they need big airports as well, which is why we have the hub and spoke model where most long distance travel requires traveling to a hub before you can start your journey to another hub where you hop on another spoke (unless the hub was your destination). This makes an already expensive journey even more expensive because you are forced to burn fuel to get to a place from where you can start your journey.<p>This problem completely goes away with electrical aviation. Big electrical airplanes would still be nice to have. But they are not essential. Mass produced small electrical planes enable people to fly from tiny airstrips; even roof tops if you consider planes with vtol capabilities. The Eviation has enough range (650 miles) that it can compete with most short haul flights.<p>I live in Germany. This plane can easily service the whole of Germany and many destinations outside of it as well. Better still, it can actually fly to any of the dozens of airports in Germany rather than only the handful of bigger airports that are currently taking most of the domestic travel (e.g. Berlin-Munich is a busy route). This massively improves how quickly you get from any point in Germany to any other point in Germany. It actually competes with both trains and planes for price and speed. A lot of domestic flights here compete on both with high speed rail.<p>Here&#x27;s some back of the envelope math. The price of 1 airbus A319 (~110M) pays for around 30-35 Eviations (~3M). An A319 transports carries 160 passengers, 30 eviations can carry 270 passengers. A typical journey for the Eviation will be a fraction of what it cost to fly a single A319. It&#x27;s tens vs. thousands of euros, i.e. two orders of magnitude. You can fly hundreds of eviations over the same distance for the same price as a single A319 journey (excluding the pilots). The main cost bottleneck is actually the pilots: there won&#x27;t be enough of them and they cost a lot per hour.<p>That is of course until we automate them away, which is likely to start happening over the next decades. IMHO this will happen with electrical planes first because they are much simpler to automate. And of course, autonomously flying planes are another thing Eviation is working on.<p>It&#x27;s a very logical strategy. I can be off by quite a large factor with these numbers and it would still be an extremely compelling business case. IMHO my numbers are long term actually extremely conservative and there is room for an order of magnitude improvement just through cost savings, already validated research around batteries, etc.<p>This first generation electrical plane completely destroys the business case for one of the most economical traditional planes flying today. As soon as they start producing this plane in volume, planes like the A319 are a thing of the past. I predict many traditional planes shipping today will be retired years or decades ahead of their currently scheduled end of life for this reason.",,jillesvangurp,,1561104567,2019-06-21T08:09:27Z,comment,20240783,20221192,,,

,,"Programming in high school is quite different than the work you will be doing in a CS program. CS is a hard, but not impossible, major. Depending upon the school it will be perhaps easier than a Physics degree and maybe a bit more work but easier than a Math degree.<p>There is too much CS to learn in four years so every program leaves something out. For example, some schools will require a class in Artificial Intelligence while others may not but will instead require a course in Data Science. So it&#x27;s hard to know exactly what you will be studying, but I can make a few suggestions that should be helpful for someone heading off to college and planning to study CS.<p>Generally, there is a lot of useful math that you may be required to learn. Usually one year of calculus, one semester of differential equations, one semester of linear algebra (matrices, etc.), one semester of statistics or probability, and one or two semesters of discrete math. It&#x27;s easy to end up with a math minor on your way to a CS degree, and I recommend getting one if you are reasonably good at math. The good thing about this selection of math subjects is that they are all in different areas and are consequently to some degree &quot;introductory&quot; or lower division. The trick at this level for doing well in math classes is simply to put in the time to do all the homework, attend all the lectures, and prepare for tests by doing every problem (even the ones not assigned as homework) from the text book sections covered in your class. If there are problems (even unsigned ones) that you can&#x27;t do, meet with the professor and get help. This is a pretty simple formula for getting A&#x27;s in math classes. This really works I&#x27;ve done it myself; I was always good at math in High School, but it took me a while to understand that doing just the assigned homework was going to result in B&#x27;s not A&#x27;s. Doing extra practice by taking a couple of Saturdays to solve every problem in the book resulted in getting the highest grades in the class. No matter where you start out, extra practice will make you better. Great athletes achieve success the same way, through more practice than others.<p>CS homework often involves programming. In your web-design class, you will write programs that implement web-sites; in your data structures class you will write programs that implement different data structures. This kind of homework has a special property unlike history homework or chemistry homework. One can be short on time and do a crappy job on a history paper or maybe get only four out of five of the chemistry homework problems done, and this might get you an 80 on the history paper or chemistry homework. In CS, the programming assignments, sometimes called labs, are different. Doing 80% of the work required to finish a program generally means a program that isn&#x27;t finished and a program that isn&#x27;t finished often doesn&#x27;t run at all or runs and produces the wrong answer. This could result in a 0 or maybe a 25 on the homework, not an 80. This means that you have to adopt a different approach to tackling labs. To avoid a disastrous grade, <i>start early</i>. If you finish your program a couple of days early you can go out and party, but I predict that you will almost always feel a lot of pressure as the deadline approaches because these labs will take more time than you think they will, so <i>start early</i>. Start on the first day, and put some time in on these projects every day.<p>Some of your classmates won&#x27;t start projects early, there are two possible consequences. They won&#x27;t be able to finish and will get a bad grade or they will realize that they aren&#x27;t going to finish and will cheat by seeking the solution on the internet. There are only so many suitable labs for the subjects you will be studying so the programs can mostly be found on the internet. You will be making a grave mistake if you take the route of starting late and then making up for it by copying someone else&#x27;s work. You have to practice programming on your own to develop your abilities and prepare yourself for a career in CS, so <i>start early</i>. By the time you are in your third or forth year, you will know which of your classmates have been doing it by themselves and which have been taking the easy way. By starting early and doing it yourself you will gradually become one of the best, and your professors and even your classmates will know it.<p>When I taught undergraduate CS classes while in grad school, I noticed two categories of students. Students that never came to see me during office hours for help and students that did come by for help. I was always happy to see someone that had obviously tried to solve a problem but was stuck or didn&#x27;t understand. Go see your professors outside of class, they will be far less scary after you get to know them. Eventually, you should get to know two or three of your professors well enough that they can be of help when applying to grad school or when looking for a job. They may be able to help you get an internship or real job during the summer. If you have a question about something that comes up in lecture, sometimes you can get a quick clarification by just walking with your professor after class on the way back to another part of campus.<p>Sadly, books are very expensive. I&#x27;ve frequently used my text books after the course is over, so I don&#x27;t recommend renting books. Used books are often almost new so I recommend keeping your books and saving money finding used books in good condition (make sure they are up to date). I have found few CS books that are as good online as the hardcopy books, so I recommend hardcopy books.<p>Team projects will come up in every CS program I&#x27;ve heard of. I hate these. (1) don&#x27;t trust your teammates to get their work done on time. (2) don&#x27;t trust them to turn the project in on time, (3) don&#x27;t trust them to do their part correctly. So, start early! Give yourself time to straighten things out if you or your teammate doesn&#x27;t get their part straight. If you have given yourself time, you can recover.<p>You are probably one of the best programmers amongst your peers if you are planning on going into CS. I was like that. There will be a great temptation to produce a fancy, faster, better, more feature-full solution in your programming assignments. That&#x27;s a great goal, but remember, when programming, things will take longer than you anticipate. So in addition to starting early, make your goal the simplest program that will satisfy the requirements of the assignment. If you&#x27;d like to do more, add it at the end if you finish early. Don&#x27;t add optional features at the beginning. Get the assignment done in time to add additional features at the end. For example, if the assignment is to write a program that will play legal chess moves, make your first goal a program that plays legal chess moves. Once that works perfectly, you can think about it making good moves.<p>If you can swing it, get yourself a second monitor in addition to the laptop you are likely planning on using for college. Having your work spread out on one screen and the assignment or java or python library documentation open on the other screen really helps. Don&#x27;t program with social media open. Don&#x27;t have your laptop open for lectures. So many students do it that it is widely accepted, but studies clearly show that hand written notes during lectures results in better retention and better grades.<p>Something you can do this summer is if you don&#x27;t touch-type yet, get one of the touch typing games and learn touch typing. Just learn the standard US keyboard layout--don&#x27;t bother with alternative layouts like Dvorak you will have to use other people&#x27;s keyboards or keyboard in the library or in the computer labs and they will all be the standard US keyboard layout.<p>In college you will have to write some papers, for CS you may have to use LaTeX. This is a very old, but very good program for writing academic papers. Almost every serious paper in CS or Math or Physics is written using LaTeX instead of MS Word. Unfortunately, LaTeX is hard to learn. So, if you want to, try learning LaTeX. There are lots of free resources on the internet. Because it produces professional results, lots of the information is very technical and applies more to people writing math books. However there are simple tutorials and you can get by with a moderate set of features to write college papers. If you look at LaTeX and it looks like something you would rather not learn this summer, try a tool called markdown. There are free markdown programs available and you can write nice papers using markdown as long as they aren&#x27;t too complex.<p>In addition to LaTeX or markdown you will need to get comfortable with a text editor of some kind. Emacs is free, old, has hundreds of built in commands, uses weird keys for things, and can do absolutely anything. Vim is also free, old and weird, but more programmers use it and it is very powerful. More modern alternatives, that you will be able to pick up faster because they do less and are not weird are Atom and Sublime Text. Each of these has it&#x27;s advantages, I like Emacs. Pick one and start using it for your programming. You will eventually have to start using a professional text editor, one of these four will be fine. See [1] for a professor&#x27;s Emacs lessons for his students, but there are many other YouTube tutorials on Emacs and these other editors.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=49kBWM3RQQ8&amp;list=PL9KxKa8NpFxIcNQa9js7dQQIHc81b0-Xg"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=49kBWM3RQQ8&amp;list=PL9KxKa8NpF...</a>",,todd8,,1590981386,2020-06-01T03:16:26Z,comment,23375194,23371530,,,

If they fired him, no one would speak out on any sensitive subject in the future even with careful moderation.<p>&quot;When people are not comfortable with an oppressive regime they keep their moderate opinions to themselves. Voicing any opinion contrary to the Party line is dangerous no matter how extreme or moderate it is.

This is an extremely different part of the government from <i>either</i> NIST <i>or</i> any of the three-letter agencies.<p>There has been exactly one backdoor found in crypto relating to the US government (Dual_EC_DRBG), and it was in crypto <i>developed by</i> the NSA and basically pushed into a standard. It was also crypto that looked extremely suspicious, immediately, to any cryptographer who looked at it: it had a contrived design for no good reason, ran much slower than the existing options in the space, and appeared to support a backdoor. A lot of people have looked at the Signal Protocol and found nothing like this.<p>The US government has been accused of hiding backdoors before in one case, DES. It turned out that they were hiding a way of strengthening DES against an attack that was not yet public (differential cryptanalysis) but had been discovered by the NSA. Nothing like this happened to Signal: the developers were not told by the government &quot;Great, just use these S-boxes instead.&quot;<p>(In fact, it occurs to me that there&#x27;s not much room in Signal for a backdoor along the above lines: no S-boxes, no constants, etc. The closest it gets to that is picking Curve25519 and Curve448, both of which are well-known curves, predating Signal, with simple mathematical descriptions that make them essentially impossible to have backdoors. Perhaps he means that the Signal <i>software</i> is backdoored? But that wouldn&#x27;t make sense with the reference to WhatsApp and Facebook, and also is a much more easily disprovable assertion than that crypto is backdoored.)<p>The US government also, of course, weakened crypto with the ridiculous export rules of the &#x27;90s. But that wasn&#x27;t a backdoor, and they were pretty explicit that the intention was to weaken crypto. The OTF has no such motivation here; their goal was to produce secure tools that can be used by dissidents around the world, and intentionally-weakened crypto would be dangerous in such a context.",,geofft,,1505797047,2017-09-19T04:57:27Z,comment,15281905,15281788,,,

However, the need to understand the compiler&#x27;s inner workings to get programs that ran efficiently by manually inserting &quot;cuts&quot; to limit backtracking ruins Prolog&#x27;s claim to being simple to translate requirements into programs.<p>Where does this claim come from? Prolog is an automated theorem prover for first-order logic theories. There have certainly been various arguments about the pros and cons of it made by many different people (not all of whom were close to the development of the language), but the fact remains that its main characteristic is the automation of a proof process.<p>You can certainly find many flaws in Prolog if you look hard enough and choose your requirements carefully (for example- it has no functions! Why has it no functions? It should have functions!

,,"In ""Marketing Warfare,"" Al Reis and Jack Trout give a rule of thumb: Never build your strategy around an opponent's weakness. Build it around their strength. Why? because weaknesses can be fixed. Strengths cannot be fixed without undermining an opponent's own strategy.<p>From this, I get that there are two kinds of problems with a product or service: A weakness, which is something bad that is orthogonal to a product's value proposition, and a drawback, which is an integral part of the value proposition. An example of an Apple drawback would have been its one button mouse for many years: During the period when many Mac buyers were first-time computer users, the single button was part of the simplicity of the interface, but it also was annoying to those who had more experience and wanted more power at their fingertips.<p>I remember this when thinking about tethering my iPad. This is a weakness, not a drawback. It can certainly be fixed without undermining the iPad's value proposition. If somebody starts selling a lot of tablets that sync to the cloud, Apple can release a firmware or iOS update that syncs to the cloud and boom, no more weakness.<p>It's annoying but it isn't deeply tied to the iPad's value proposition. So I predict that if and when Apple thinks it is more of a hinderance than a help, it will be changed, and the change will be fairly painless.",,raganwald,,1299374642,2011-03-06T01:24:02Z,comment,2293123,2292081,,,

My friends and I had not yet found a suitable World Cup prediction competition site.<p>I immediately signed up, and was ready to send off some invites, when I found that Scoragora wanted me to predict a score for each of the 48 matches in group play, a fairly tedious exercise. Further, upon completion, it is completely unclear whether the game will be calculating winners and runners-up from the groups automatically, whether there will be an opportunity to pick winners in the knockout rounds—basically everything after group play is a mystery.<p>Suffice to say this is not what I expected. I can understand some need for score predictions—most likely in the later rounds for tie-breaking purposes (perhaps the best way to handle this is to ask users to predict the cumulative goal differential of the winning side). But score predictions ultimately aren&#x27;t the core functionality of a game like this. If I predict that Brazil will defeat Mexico 4-0, and my friend predicts that Brazil will win 4-1, I don&#x27;t really care who was right about the score, we both rightly acknowledged that Mexico is a shambles at the moment (poor Chicharito—he&#x27;s only 26!) and that Brazil ought to win.<p>The functionality I expect to see front-and-center is, simply put, predictions about who wins each match through the final. I truly can&#x27;t tell whether that functionality exists in Scoragora right now, and I don&#x27;t really care to predict 96 scores for the privilege of finding out. Moreover, I&#x27;m the geek in my group of friends, there&#x27;s at least some chance I might fill out the entire prediction form to satiate my curiosity about how you&#x27;ve constructed this web app, but I&#x27;m certain none of my friends will have the patience to do so, so I won&#x27;t be inviting them, and we&#x27;ll conduct our competition elsewhere.<p>UPDATE: I&#x27;ve just tried out Yahoo&#x27;s game, and theirs is structured almost identically (though a bit prettier), so maybe my expectations are out of line? I don&#x27;t understand why the game basically resets when the knockout rounds begin.

,,"Here you go.<p>Oracle is the Borg: Enterprise Software Development Will Be Assimilated<p>By gherlein, on November 6th, 2010 - No comments<p>Oracle made some moves this week that look like the opening pawn moves in a master chess game.  The end game will have Oracle having a controlling position in every aspect of Enterprise software development.<p>First of all, Oracle has removed InnoDB from the MySQL Classic Edition. Now, you can still get the GPL community edition that has InnoDB in it.  But if you want support, you’ll have to buy their version.  Oh, and they just raised the price on that.  I’m not sure if they require it or not, but if you use Linux Oracle prefers that you run their software on THEIR version of Linux – a customized Red Hat.  This week they also released plans for the JVM that will include a free version and a premium paid version.  Oh, and if you want some new hardware that will really make it all work well together, they can sell you that too (they bought Sun, remember?).<p>So it’s pretty clear to me that Oracle is playing for keeps, and playing to own the Enterprise space.  Want to use a database?   Buy Oracle, or use MySQL… but if you want support, you pay them.  Then you pay them for Linux.   Then license the JVM.  Then license the app server (they bought BEA last year, so WebLogic is all theirs now too).  Want to code in Java?  Well, they own that too.  Business folks call this “owning the vertical.”<p>Watch for them to take even more steps to make sure that they have control points around as many places they can.  Nearly all software that gets written is business application software.  Clearly Oracle has been embedded firmly there for a long time – but these moves are enveloping and will sink hooks into so many more places.   I predict that when Google and Oracle settle – and they will eventually, since the cost to litigate a huge patent battle does no good for either party – that Oracle will get some hooks into mobile as well.  Maybe some email integration, or provisioning, or something deep and fundamental.<p>So watch out, stay alert, and think about your tools.

For example, here [1] are two forecasts that predict H2 will account for ~10% of global energy use. This could just be dismissed as &quot;hype&quot; but across China, Europe, and elsewhere, real money is going into electrolyzers and fuel cells (at, I dunno, 500% YOY growth?) which I think is why stocks are acting as they are.<p>Here&#x27;s a list of where H2 fits in, and other sustainable alternatives. (Of course, for all entries, &quot;indefinite fossil fuel usage&quot; is an option in some sense!)<p>Current H2 usage. Fossil-derived hydrogen is a cornerstone of the economy (for eg fertilizer), and responsible for a few % of global GHG emissions. Replacing that with low-carbon-intensity hydrogen would be a major win by itself. Kind of by definition, there are few alternatives here.<p>Other industrial uses. The production of steel, plastics, etc are complicated systems, each too complicated to explain here, but eg HYBRIT [2], a fossil-free steel plant, could reduce emissions from Nordic countries by 7-10%. I have not heard of many alternative decarbonization pathways here.<p>Non-passenger-vehicle transport (trucks, ships, planes, trains). Molecular fuels have higher energy density than current-gen batteries by 1-2 orders of magnitude. I predict that these vehicles will mostly not be battery-powered. Biofuels are another prospect. &quot;E-fuels&quot; (sourced from H2 and an atmospheric carbon source) are another.<p>Lots more. Intermittent renewable valorization, building heat, power storage, gas pipeline admixtures... but this comment is already too long.

Cash has serial numbers, fingerprints, and DNA all over them (I&#x27;m surprised we don&#x27;t hear more about cash forensics, or bugged cash with tracking chips in them).<p>Cash will still be used for the last mile, for the street-level &quot;retail&quot; transactions. But when those get gathered up and need to be sent back to headquarters, or between organizations, or to other nations, the backhaul, by necessity, needs to run on something more sophisticated. Today, that seems to be Bitcoin, even though I agree with you that it is far from perfect. Its first-mover advantage is allowing it to build a robust ecosystem of services that is making it that much harder for an incumbent to take its place. But when that super currency does come, and crime shifts to using it, I predict a relatively straight decline in BitCoin value.",,thinkloop,,1375988434,2013-08-08T19:00:34Z,comment,6181003,6179763,,,

Amazon diversified its product in 2005 and continued to do so now it has so much more capital to invest.<p>But Google destroyed Yahoo, MSN and AOL, and other web directory websites out of business.<p>MySpace is sold. Yahoo is sold. Tumblr&#x27;s ability to make profit is questionable, and will likely fail eventually. Blackberry failed to come back.

Also, these governments are less reserved and more brazen; NSA surely has private emails of Russian politicians, but it&#x27;s unlikely they&#x27;d ever release them publicly to influence an upcoming election.<p>In China or Russia, the government can just decide to ban access to Wikipedia, Twitter, and Facebook on a whim.

Because they just lost their biggest customer, China.  The very customer that was bringing in all the profits, in order for them to reinvest back into the business, and get better at their craft.<p>Trump just nuked their profits, and he expects TSMC to just sell to non-Chinese companies. Granted, right now, it’s just Huawei, but gradually, all the other Chinese companies are going to leave, or will be forced out. They now all have a bright red target on their backs.<p>Good luck making all that profit back from just selling to Apple and nVidia. Apple takes the lion’s share of the iPhone profits, and the CPU contract manufacturer takes a small fraction.  Apple only went with TSMC, in order to prevent Samsung, from getting a clue of what they were up to.<p>Next, I predict that this will have further chain reaction consequences.<p>Trump will restrict ASML from selling to China, the photolithography equipment, if they haven’t already. So China will step up their R&amp;D to develop it indigenously.  SMIC just achieved 14-nm, so they’re not so far behind, maybe 5 to 10 years, but they’re reliant on ASML.  So they’re about to get their legs cut off from under them.  The Americans just sucker-punched them. So they’re down, but they’re not out.  Not yet.  They’ll eventually replace ASML, since this is now an existential crisis for them.<p>The next domino to fall, will be Android. When China comes back online with their own competitive CPUs, then Android will be made irrelevant, because Huawei will move forward with their Harmony OS.<p>They are using it now, inside their smart TVs, and this is like a Trojan Horse tactic for them. Use the OS to learn of a non-competitive ecosystem, TVs, and get it ready for the main event, mobile devices and computer systems.<p>With the fall of Android, then Google takes a hit.  Their search engine will no longer be as relevant to mobile users. This leads to a possibly massive reduction of ad revenue, and so forth.<p>Then, as we were all probably expecting, mobile OS and desktop OS are converging. The Harmony OS might also compete against Apple MacOS, and Microsoft Windows.  Thus, in one swoop, Huawei might just knock out 3 American tech giants: Google, Microsoft, and Apple. Of course, these companies will forever be relevant in America, and other rich western countries, but they’re about to be made irrelevant in China, and likely, in the global south (Africa, Southeast Asia, India, and South America). These poorer countries were never going to buy a pointless $1200 iPhone 14 anyways.

As a web developer, I'd always hoped that some big industry player would start forcing people to use modern browsers, and now it's happening.<p>As small players, dropping support for older browsers kind of pulls us into the morass of a Nash equilibrium. Everyone would benefit if all web developers could agree on requiring modern browsers.

But as an individual web developer, I can't very well just make that call and hope others will follow suit.

This is not the whole situation, of course; e.g. districts are more  gerrymandered than ever, reducing competitiveness and allowing party establishments to push their favored candidates (out of touch establishment = unpopular candidate); e.g. the last congress was the most dysfunctional in decades, meaning that the bills that made it were compromises, and not a full test of democrat ideas; media echo chambers have polarized voters; etc.<p>As easy as it is to critique Obama&#x27;s policies on privacy &amp; foreign policy, he was assured and rational, which people like in a leader.

,,"As seen here: <a href=""http://www.gibsonandlily.com/blogs/72"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gibsonandlily.com/blogs/72</a><p>I have heard countless rumors like this one; about apple developing a tablet.<p>The question becomes ""why?"".<p>I think that very few people would try to make the argument that the iPhone has NOT been a phenomenal success. Lets look at why...<p>The iPhone is a computer. A pretty one, that can run lots of shiny, pretty apps covered in gradients. When people see it, they are immediately aware of how hip the person wielding it is. Apple took everything great about their desktop computers (pretty, fashionable, stable, simple) and condensed them all into a small, even more fashionable, even more convenient, simple package called an iBook. Coffee shop dwellers wielding an iBook could let their fellow caffeine-solution enjoyers just how hip they were, just how PRODUCTIVE they were with their wonderful macbooks.<p>Then came the iPhone. Apple took all the wonderful things about their desktops (stability, simplicity, etc.) plus all the wonderful things about their notebooks (simple, fashionable) and combined them into a wonderful even MORE portable packaged called an iPhone. This iPhone could be carried in its owner's pocket. The look-at-me oppurtunities were endless. People could admire the superior technical prowess (complete with white apple logo displayed in stark contrast the black case on the back of the thing) of iPhone users on the train, or on the bus, or on the sidewalk, or in a coffee shop, or the office, or in the kitchen, at a restaurant...ANYWHERE!<p>A tablet, however...what does this supposedly offer that the iPhone doesn't? It isn't as mobile, meaning less oppurtunites for look-at-me, it would likely run Mac OSX or some derivative of it.. meaning a hefty tax to the apple gods...it would undoubtedly be covered in ultra-high-gloss plastic, meaning that any hopes of replacing something like a panasonic toughbook would be seriously mis-guided.<p>The only market that apple has not yet tried to dominate, and that it is in any sort of position to even enter, is netbooks.<p>They had a sort-of false-start called the MacBook Air, something that I think everybody would agree is an example of just how much of a failure apple can produce.<p>The next itteration of the iPhone is, most certainly, a netbook. The question is whether or not apple is willing to forfeit its position as a luxury item in exchange for increased penetration. A sub-300-dollar netbook is something that is likely NOT in apple's future.<p>Apple has got something really great going for them right now. People WANT an apple. Macs are seen as something that is, in some way, better than their windows-based counterparts. Even Microsoft seems to be willing to admit this in their latest ads.<p>In conclusion, apple will NOT be creating a tablet; it simply does not follow with the current trend of their products. If anything, they will produce a $500 netbook that is still seen as ""better"" than its competitors. If this happens, I predict low market penetration and ultimate failure.",,blhack,,1248643012,2009-07-26T21:16:52Z,comment,724899,724520,,,

,,"That depends on your perspective, and what you value in a monetary supply.<p>If deflation outstrips investment returns, then yes - that would cause capital to stay in one place, as people wouldn't want to spend money that would be worth more tomorrow. Investment would stop, businesses couldn't get financing, and everything would grind to a halt.<p>That's not a sustainable situation though; there will never be a time when all units of currency are held, nothing changes hands, and value is infinite. Instead, as value increases there will be profit-taking, which will hold down the value to some point. With the current relative lack of liquidity, you get a boom/bust cycle (the price will shoot up as more people try to get in on the value incrase, then confidence falters and the price crashes back to near baseline).<p>This has already happened once for Bitcoin, and it's important to note that the value over time has been somewhat linear when you account for the impact of the boom/bust.<p>As the liquidity of the market increases due to wider adoption, then you'll start to see the cycles increase in duration, as the market seeks balance. There will always be fluctuations, though, so the ultimate goal is ubiquitous use of Bitcoin in the general economy, and years- or decades- long variance in value.<p>I believe we're entering a new phase of growth, which will be sustained. I predict we'll see a good-sized correction relatively soon, and lots of smaller ones on the way up, but otherwise the value of Bitcoin in USD will steadily rise for the foreseeable future.<p>This doesn't look like another boom to me.

,,"This is quaint but looks too much like &quot;look how I solved this&quot; (PS. give me funding) multiple weeks after the fact, and is definitely coming from such a bureaucratic environment. The overall approach leaves the critical question of service-specific security policy development out of scope.<p>We&#x27;ve had NSA SEL since 2000, the reason it&#x27;s rarely used is that regular people don&#x27;t have time to grok that level of detail. In response, we have things like <i>grsec</i> learning mode.<p>As with any time app-specific ACLs are brought out, the <i>real</i> question here is process, not technology. I would argue that what is really needed is not a kernel-specific solution or a protocol-specific solution (noticed how many of the new SOA infrastructure half-solutions are HTTP-only or port-level only regarding network policy?) but rather a generic, industry-wide approach toward multi-faceted security policy generation for arbitrary services including all aspects of service behavior (at both host and network levels). That in turn requires a virtualization paradigm, networking paradigm and OS neutral service devops process. This is something that we are moving towards slowly (eg. widespread <i>git</i> use, standardish build tools, containers, VLANs), but is not widely discussed.<p>We have the tools in major kernels already: syscall monitoring, relatively mature multi-subsystem security policies, network ACLs and monitoring systems, increasingly sophisticated networking virtualization solutions like Open vSwtich, filesystem-neutral monitoring. The pain in the ass is putting it all together in an average-app grokkable manner that doesn&#x27;t demand comprehension of low-level OS internals from regular developers, nitpicking application behaviour comprehension from operations infrastructure, or the employment of security nerds to reap the benefits of some of the available lower-level technologies.<p>I fear commercial offerings will never take us to this position: it&#x27;s simply not an easy sell (intangible, long term benefits vs. shorter overall timeframe and less cognitive overhead &#x2F; requisite management grok for current and familiar development processes) and too complex to implement .. in most cases requiring a complete devops process change. Instead, I predict that we will slowly see open source devops tools layer upon RCS&#x2F;VCS to provide a common continuous integration &#x2F; deployment process that integrates effective multi-subsystem application profiling for security policy development in parallel to regression tests and other pre-deployment processes.<p>Further personal thoughts on this area @ <a href=""http://stani.sh/walter/pfcts"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stani.sh&#x2F;walter&#x2F;pfcts</a>",,contingencies,,1413155924,2014-10-12T23:18:44Z,comment,8446894,8445419,,,

Who is the next Groupon (for Google to buy)?,http://www.ricmerrifield.com/2010/12/whos-the-next-groupon-who-will-google-go-after-next/,"Although there was an article in the paper suggesting that Google's offer of $6 billion for Groupon wasn't totally nuts given that they are already at a run rate of over $1 billion, so $6B is really only a bit over 4x revenue.  True, but I predict that it will go down as one of the most spectacularly poor decisions on the part of Groupon for passing on that deal.  There are no barriers to entry into the space and there are a lot of known flaws in the model, and a lot of fast followers like Tippr that could easily do to Groupon what Facebook did to Myspace (Myspace stumbled and Facebook replaced them and that was that).<p>So who is next?<p>Well there are lots of interesting companies for Google to buy, but as they look to grow their enterprise business which is already a very respectable 10% of revenues, expanding their offerings to further differentiate and offering more to customers seems like a smart play.  So who has a cloud based solution that already has strong revenue in space that Google has no presence, but that company has stumbled a bit of late?<p>Before I throw out the name, here's a quote from a December 11, 2010 Standard &#38; Poor's report:<p>""Worldwide revenues associated with applications deliverable under a software-as-a-service model are expected to increase to $20.6 billion by 2014 from an estimated $8.1 billion in 2009, according to a June 2010 report by IDC, a market research firm.  This represents a compound annual growth rate of 20.4% from 2009 to 2014.  Customer relationship management is one segment that in our view, is well-suited for on-demand delivery.  Other areas include procurement, travel and expense management, certain areas of human capital management, and enterprise resource planning.""<p>One company that comes to mind is salesforce.com (ticker CRM).  Great business to get into, but the issue with trying to buy salesforce is that their stock is about $140 a share right now, which is over 250 higher than earnings per share which is in the stratosphere with a market cap of over $18 billion.  Wrong timing for bringing in a small amount of profit for that much money.<p>So who else?  The S&#38;P report above also mentioned expense management.  Ever heard of Concur Technologies (ticker CNQR)?  They are a great story.  They were an almost dead dot com company that sold license software to enterprise, they have very successfully migrated to being a software-as-a-service company.  If I am not mistaken the stock got well under a dollar per share at the low and now it has been back over $50 per share.  But at the moment they are also trading with a pretty high price/earnings per share ratio of about 138, but last month a report on Concur from Merrill Lynch was called ""Outlook good, but not enough"" and just last week Standard &#38; Poor's lowered their recommendation on Concur from Hold to Sell.  The message in the reports is consistently that the news is good, but not good enough to support a P/E ratio of 138, which means that the current market cap of Concur ($2.8 billion) is probably around what it would cost Google (or someone else) to buy them.<p>Google has the money, it expands their offerings overnight.  Expense management is much less complicated than something like customer relationship management to sell or deliver.  Why wouldn't they buy them to expand their enterprise business and offer more to customers?<p>-Ric",,Ricmerrifield,2,1293041309,2010-12-22T18:08:29Z,story,2031941,,0,,
Ask HN: How can I become politically active and promote Asian-American rights?,,"I am Asian-American, and I&#x27;m growing concerned over rising discrimination against Asian-Americans.

,,"CS programs for undergraduate majors have a real dilemma. What programming language should they teach their students. My own kids are studying CS in college so I&#x27;ve seen the curriculums for a number of universities, and I&#x27;ve spoken to the faculty responsible for the language choices at some top programs. To me, there isn&#x27;t an obvious best programming language to study as an undergraduate.<p>Some schools have a bifurcated curriculum, like Indiana University which has a program in Informatics for those planning to go into a career the requires programming and software engineering skills and a program in CS for those perhaps planning on going into grad school. There, learning Haskell might make sense in the CS program, but does it make sense for other students that want to get out and get a job?<p>My own daughter studied at a school where her first CS class was taught in Scheme (Racket). It, to me, looked like an excellent introduction to programming for someone majoring in CS. They used a book I approved of, <i>How to Design Programs&#x2F;2ed</i> by Felleisen, et. al. Would Haskell have been better? Maybe, but I predict that more kids would have serious problems with a language like Haskell that is burdened with more challenging concepts and ecosystem. Perhaps Lisp&#x2F;Scheme is a gentler introduction to applicative programming than Haskell. However most schools start with Python or Java.<p>I understand the arguments for a strongly typed functional programming language like Haskell (my own university research was in program verification many years ago).<p>Early on in CS programs students usually take one or two classes on data structures and algorithms. Data structures in my opinion needs to be taught in C. Haskell, Lisp&#x2F;Scheme, Python, Java, and even modern C++ are so high level that teaching data structures in these languages ends up with students not learning the proper use of these languages&#x27; standard libraries.<p>At some point undergraduates should have an introduction to systems programming, the best text in this area is <i>Computer Systems: A Programmer&#x27;s Perspective&#x2F;2ed</i> by Randal E. Bryant and David R. O&#x27;Hallaron. This is a great book for undergraduate CS majors. This book requires C programming. So to me, it makes sense to teach data structures in C since students will need to understand it for their first exposure to systems programming.<p>Where should Python fit in the curriculum? It&#x27;s arguably the most versatile programming language. What about Javascript? When should CS majors be exposed to it. Modern Java is a big language so one semester of use isn&#x27;t going to be enough and it&#x27;s too important to ignore. What about C++? It takes years of working with it to become a good but not expert programmer in C++. Should it be a part of the curriculum?<p>So my own recommendations for an undergrad CS program&#x27;s language choices would be:<p>* Python -- for intro to programming, a course on algorithms, and a machine learning course<p>* C -- for an early class on data structures and a later class on systems programming<p>* Java -- software engineering, and a compiler course<p>* Lisp -- programming languages smorgasbord course, and an AI course<p>* Assembly -- hardware architecture&#x2F;digital design course<p>* Javascript -- taught as part of a web-applications class<p>* Haskell or OCaml (or maybe Rust) -- intro to functional programming and program verification<p>What do HN readers think about this list? I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to make the real decisions there are just too many languages that students need to learn in just a few years.<p>As far are my own background I have spent a great deal of time pursuing three different degrees from three different universities in CS. I&#x27;ve been the instructor for  university courses for CS majors twice and taught perhaps 40 week long classes to professional programmers within a Fortune 500 company. I&#x27;ve also interviewed and hired many senior developers for my own company.",,todd8,,1590867965,2020-05-30T19:46:05Z,comment,23363994,23362856,,,

,,"Sure but the AI wouldn&#x27;t necessarily have to respond. I think the main flaw in the Turing test is it&#x27;s cultural dependence. I would argue that Eliza has passed plenty of Turing tests, mostly with people who had a chance encounter with it.<p>But why would an AGI individual have to be able to lie about it&#x27;s childhood ? It could simply have a childhood. But I understand your argument : &quot;Human&quot; AI is constantly trained for the function &quot;be a human&quot;. Machine intelligence is being trained with &quot;is human X cheating&quot;, &quot;is this spam&quot;, &quot;what is the french for apple&quot;, &quot;which way will stock X go&quot; (and other &quot;what will &lt;large number of humans&gt; do in situation X&quot; questions) ... functions.<p>Keep in mind that your own brain is also simply running an algorithm, with &quot;hidden state&quot;. Here&#x27;s the first thing it hides pretty well : there&#x27;s no single &quot;you&quot;, there&#x27;s about 300 regions in your brain, that are physically different, in different locations, and not directly linked. And if the rest of your brain gets disabled, each of those 300 regions can use your body to convince your own mother it&#x27;s really you she&#x27;s talking to. And the function your brain is executing is not to &quot;have a soul&quot; or something like that, but is mostly a behaviour-copy algorithm. It searches out other humans, observes their actions, learns to predict them and then uses what it&#x27;s learned to &quot;be you&quot;. Most people will not believe this is how it works, not even when they know quite a bit about neurons, and know pretty well that this is what our neurons do.<p>But when it comes right down to it, you, me, everyone is an &quot;AI algorithm&quot; just like Google search. Aside from the shear scale, number of connections mostly, there is nothing all that remarkable about the hardware it&#x27;s running on.<p>I love how an AGI algorithm is presented in the follow up to the Battlestar Galactica series, &quot;Caprica&quot;. Zoe Graystone explains it at one point in the series. It&#x27;s fiction of course, but still. Her algorithm searches the internet, your computer, and everything and anything it can find for pictures and videos of it&#x27;s &quot;target&quot; and then builds the function &quot;given situation X, what would &lt;human&gt; do ?&quot; and then puts the algorithm in a virtual body that looks like the human, and uploads it to V-world. She runs it on herself, a friend and accidentally on a third person she doesn&#x27;t know and then proceeds to get herself blown up by a friend&#x2F;terrorist (they can be both at the same time, you know) in the first episode, and their avatars wake up in V-world, sort of a facebook virtual reality edition, unaware of what has happened (and as V-world is mostly used for sex, dancing and debauchery it&#x27;s not that easy to find out unless you&#x27;re looking for it). Currently we don&#x27;t have nearly enough data on any person to make this work ... but I am pretty convinced it is possible to make this work.<p>This would work, since it&#x27;s doing the same thing your brain does when it hears the question &quot;do you remember feeling happy when your mother held you when you were a baby ?&quot;. First, your brain doesn&#x27;t actually remember that either way. It simply works it&#x27;s way through to a good answer to that question. The thing it&#x27;ll do is predict how you should answer that question, given (mostly) how other humans answer that question.<p>This is a very different problem from &quot;lying about its childhood&quot;, specifically it&#x27;s much more solvable. Can I predict how humans would answer questions about their childhood ? Certainly. Easy. Make the algorithm take enough contextual information into account (so that it both realizes what realistic answers are and either answers realistically or responds in a way that humans respond when they don&#x27;t have a &quot;good prediction&quot; for an answer, for instance by saying they don&#x27;t remember, or by changing the subject, or ...)<p>If you have young kids you will see this process in action. You have to &quot;teach&quot; kids memory. When they talk only a little, if you ask them something about earlier that day, they will respond. And the response makes sense, but it&#x27;s not actually what happened. You will at some point realise this and correct them. Correcting them teaches them to match up what happened with their response, because they learn to predict that that&#x27;s what&#x27;s expected of people. Over time this correcting them will work, and they will have learned memory (and then they learn to lie, especially on questions like &quot;did you hit your sister ?&quot;, and when that ends badly they learn to &quot;not lie&quot;, like adults do. &quot;Did you hit your sister ?&quot; &quot;She stole my lego&quot;).<p>Note that the underlying memory is also a prediction. If I ask you what happened this morning, and you want to try to answer correctly, you will start with an obvious fact (which isn&#x27;t necessarily the truth), like &quot;I woke up&quot;. Your brain will take that thought, and predict (not remember) what happened next. So I woke up, ok next, brushing teeth, ok next, read cell phone messages, ok next, ... ah ! the answer to the question.",,waps,,1427641274,2015-03-29T15:01:14Z,comment,9285040,9284776,,,

,,"&gt;I predict that 10 years from now normal relational databases have infrastructure for shared, authenticated and verified rows<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand what you&#x27;re predicting exactly. The big breakthrough of bitcoin is having a globally shared ledger without requiring any trust. In my experience most relational databases have a relatively straightforward trust model (i.e. the DB belongs to the organization using it and is fully trusted). In these situation the blockchain is completely overkill and unnecessary as far as I can tell.<p>There are cases where one might want to distribute the database for redundancy or archival (like the contents of Wikipedia for instance) but in this case you trust the original issuer and you only need to be able to validate the authenticity and integrity of a copy which can be easily achieved by having Wikimedia signing a hash (or merkle tree) of the dump. All these technologies are involved in the blockchain but they&#x27;re not innovations. Basically you have bitcoin minus the mining, so just a fancy linked list of SH256 hashes.<p>On the other hand if you have a use case where you want to arbiter a database across untrusted people then you must make mining rewarding enough that you reach a critical mass that makes attacks impractical. I can&#x27;t imagine how you could do that without the &quot;coin&quot; part. People mine cryptocurrencies not because they want to protect it but rather because they want to make a profit out of it. Remove the mining rewards out of Bitcoin and watch as the mining power collapses to a tiny fraction of its current value. If you want to protect your distributed Wikipedia article history and there&#x27;s no direct monetary reward for it I doubt you&#x27;ll reach a very high hash rate which will make it relatively easy for a dedicated attacker to rewrite history.<p>The &quot;coin&quot; moniker is not just a lack of imagination by people working with this technology, it&#x27;s an integral part of why it works in the first place.",,simias,,1516126627,2018-01-16T18:17:07Z,comment,16160522,16159641,,,

We acknowledge that our biological reward systems can be hijacked via junk food and we have erected massive systems to curtail these destructive impulses. Despite this, there are still those who gorge themselves on unhealthy food due to their lack of education and&#x2F;or an inability to afford healthier food. As soon as the negative effects of social media begin to manifest themselves in the upper classes (students failing classes en masse, severe incompetence in the job market, increased generation of brain-dead media) new platforms will be created to allow people to take advantage of technology without being caught up in the biological loopholes that modern social media create. The majority of the lower classes will continue to use exploitative platforms, which will probably become much worse as it is made more explicit that their user-base is made up of a cattle-caste. Much like food, I predict that the health-conscious platforms will erect paywalls and other barriers to entry that will further cement the class divide.

The only prediction I&#x27;ll make is in the domain where I work:<p>By the end of the decade, most people will be wearing some kind of immersive computing device (glasses, contacts, perhaps neurological etc) all day which allow software to proxy most aspects of their visual and audio perception, perhaps more.<p>Among the many results of this change, the most profound will be the loss of physical co-presence as a factor for interacting with other people. People will routinely &#x27;beam in&#x27; each other (similar to FaceTime conceptually, but with no visual or auditory perceptual deficiency vs being together in person) in varying contexts for varying purposes.<p>The technical miracle aside, this will cause a fundamental shift in the way we think about what it means to &quot;be&quot; with other people -- the dependence upon physical co-locality will be no longer something we place highly in our mental model for spending time with others, other than children.<p>This will affect nearly every industry in terms of economics, some sectors potentially catastrophically like long distance transportation, but the biggest effect will be degree to which we will become able to empathize with others around the world and create novel, deeply impactful forms of interacting with others in a physical and emotional sense.<p>I suspect, perhaps hope, that the dominating result will be that, in combination with new forms of media based upon these new technological marvels, we will be able to greatly reduce or eliminate the tribalist tendencies we have for one another when those &#x27;others&#x27; are out-of-reach for us to talk with, hug, dance with, and learn from.<p>In 2030, you&#x27;ll be able to hug anyone on Earth instantly, and that&#x27;s something to be optimistic about.",,gfodor,,1577901155,2020-01-01T17:52:35Z,comment,21929300,21928734,,,

Creating the search index is a huge investment on Google&#x27;s side, both in terms of time (can&#x27;t crawl too fast or else they knock the target offline) and in terms of bandwidth, CPU power, and storage space. But Google needs to operate their search profitably, on average, or else they will go bust.

,,"There are largely three branches of data science jobs, each with their own typical gotchas.<p>1) Data engineering. I suck at this, don&#x27;t ask me.<p>2) Inference. One big gotcha is often of the form of not accounting for all the sources of variation in your estimator and thinking you have something when you don&#x27;t (often coming from unaccounted sources of correlation in time or space or repeated measures). Another is that correlation isn&#x27;t causation. This pops up in surprising ways. Or things not being as independent as you thought.<p>3) Prediction&#x2F;classification. Gotchas take as many forms as the things you look at, but the birds eye view is that you apply a method and it works ok, but either not well enough, or you then try it in the real world and it doesn&#x27;t generalize as well as it did on your test set. The ways models break down depend heavily on the model and the data, so the way to diagnose and fix the issue depends on both understanding your toolkit really well and understanding the context of the data (business logic, etc). Another gotcha is in understanding uncertainties of your predictions. If I predict that this word is a noun, how sure am I of that? Many beginners skip those kinds of questions, but don&#x27;t realize it.<p>I&#x27;m a data scientist with (barely) a bachelor&#x27;s in physics working with mostly PhD&#x27;s and, while the academic degree based gatekeeping is bad and frustrates the shit out of me, I get why it&#x27;s there.

The Yahoo directory itself (Yang&#x27;s Hierarchical Officious Oracle or Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle) was carried forward for a while as DMOZ (since killed), and has certain similarities to Wikipedia, though that focuses on <i>knowledge</i> and not necessarily <i>webpages</i>.  To that extent, <i>I find Wikipedia more useful today</i>, because <i>it tells me what I&#x27;m looking to find out</i>, rather than <i>directing me to some page</i>, which may, or quite probably, may not, have what I&#x27;m looking for.  And in either case, almost certainly assaults my senses.<p>Yahoo also served as an information hub.

One of the first online web-based email services (and still a large, though declining, share of the market, along with Aol and Hotmail, along with a few other relics).<p>The consumerisation of Yahoo was already turning me off by the late 1990s, and I remember running across the first print magazine pushing that side of the company in San Francisco in the late 1990s &#x2F; early 2000s, and deciding that the company had jumped the shark so far as I was concerned.

Even better if you can improve upon the home in ways that increase the resale value.  Depending on the state of the housing market, it gives the potential to hedge inflation.  Homes can be inherited and passed on to descendants.  Perhaps one could hold their wealth in precious metals as an alternative, but those metals don&#x27;t provide value until they are cashed out.  A home, on the other hand, provides constant value because you get to live in it and do with it as you please (HOAs and other regulatory bodies notwithstanding).<p>When you <i>rent</i> a home, you are paying to pretend like you own the place.  You cannot sell the home, any improvements you make to it benefits the landlord, and you cannot put your home in a will.  In other words, when you hand in your rent check every month, that wealth might as well have disappeared into the ether.<p>It&#x27;s hard to speak for other parts of the world, but my experience in California is that the concept of a &quot;starter home&quot; is a thing of the past.  Yes, there are swaths of small homes that may become available, but one that isn&#x27;t horribly dated can be hard or in disrepair to come by, and these days the price of an existing starter home is pretty outrageous.  Whenever you see new construction, typically it&#x27;s one of 4 things: mansions, McMansions, condos, and large-scale apartment complexes.  My assumption is the reason you don&#x27;t see new starter homes being built is because the only way for developers to make a meaningful profit after years of fighting for municipal approvals is to build one of those 4 types of homes I mentioned because they have the highest return upon sale.<p>Seriously, just take a tour of the Southern California area.  You are unlikely to find new single family homes being built that aren&#x27;t McMansions.  Nearly all of the starter homes that would be appropriate for a young couple and a couple of small kids are occupied by retirees, are in need of renovation, and are in less favorable areas.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s different around the rest of the country and the world, but with the way the housing market and the economy are going, as well as the direction that UN governments want to take things, I predict that will be a spreading and continuing trend.<p>If it wasn&#x27;t so costly, time consuming, and an overall hassle to build homes of various sizes, more people might be able to maintain and build wealth even in the face of inflation.  Otherwise, their currency mostly sits and rots, or gets lost in bad stock market gambles.<p>Hell, just try building a &quot;tiny house&quot; and see how that goes.  Many of the people that build those have to build them on wheels for a reason, and not necessarily because they want a quirky portable home.<p>EDIT: Oh, and about the labor force thing... if people have the hope of being to able to own a home and build their own little fiefdom like their parents and grandparents did, they might choose to participate as opposed to being part of the mass workforce exodus we&#x27;ve seen recently.  After all, if you have no hope of owning a home and you probably won&#x27;t retire, why spend your life working hard rather than just working minimally to get by?  Even I would work way harder if I didn&#x27;t think that home ownership would be futile or at most a Pyrrhic victory.",,ravenstine,,1639156735,2021-12-10T17:18:55Z,comment,29512530,29511889,,,

,,"Hello there,<p>Kindly I address you and sincerely this is not intended as spam or self promoting but a sincere invitation to all and my passion like all free minded individuals like a lot of you no doubt learned &amp; clearly enlightened individuals to share with those that believe in the same ideals and in the process help you make a mega fortune up to 1000% returns or more in 5 years with options to withdraw earnings monthly or yearly which you can do anonymously too I want to introduce you to Bitcoin Private Bank &amp; Blaze Power Corporation. Lets put this in perspective. If you deposit 1BTC today with Bitcoin Private Bank you are guaranteed to earn 16.67% interest every month this is guaranteed regardless of market conditions this is the banks base  interest rate you will always get this no matter what which is better than keeping Bitcoin in a non interest bearing Bitcoin wallet this revenue can also help you mitigate the ever increasing Bitcoin transfer fees &amp; constant rate fluctuations it is also safer than cold storage because the bank stands guarantor for your funds (better than FDIC). Cold storage is not entirely safe because you can lose or corrupt the hardware, key store even a paper wallet can be lost or stolen cold storage is not a fool proof solution (read on it gets better). But for the more ambitious individual there is even greater reward when you invest rather than just banking &amp; I will elaborate. Looking at Blaze Power market share 100% (there is no direct competitor i.e based on rate of production &amp; service revenue from wholesale discounted power supply). The actual growth rate of Blaze Power Corporation is thus in excess of this, 1BTC investment in Blaze Power Corporation today would net you $3,000,000.00 in 5 years, that is $50,000.00 earned every month for a 1BTC investment this is not theory or speculation, ponzi or a pyramid but based on actual performance &amp; energy market fundamentals. Obviously like any other IPO (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft including early days of Bitcoin etc) the trick is to buy as many shares as you can then watch the value of your shares grow as the company expands rapidly &amp; watch yourself go from Bitcoin to Millionaire in a short space of time. Impossible? Well unlike Facebook, Google, Twitter or Microsoft we actually have a world changing tangible product worth trillions &amp; a life critical &amp; essential service (Unlimited Electricity which ironically is also the backbone of all Bitcoin mining, the major overhead &amp; determines the difference between break even or bankruptcy in Bitcoin mining thus how can you go wrong?). What or who is Blaze Power Corporation? Well I will elaborate. I am CEO of Blaze Power Corporation. My company is here <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blaze-power.eu"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blaze-power.eu</a> and just like Germany we have a big drive toward the eradication of the Nuclear danger &amp; threat. We have created a revolutionary new way to create power without nuclear waste or hot fission radioactive reaction. We have invented reactive power reactor or Fueless Energy Acquisition Reactor &quot;FEAR Tech™&quot; as we acronym it (see the website) worth untold billions even trillions of EUR&#x2F;GBP&#x2F;USD whichever you prefer. You can invest in this marvelous technology with Bitcoin (or regular Bank Transfers if anonymity is of no concern to you) through a Bitcoin offshore investment bank <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitcoin-bank.trade"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitcoin-bank.trade</a> to also help raise awareness in the future of Green Energy, privacy which are all under threat. DO NOT take my word for it just read the Testimonials &amp; see what existing clients have to say. To put this into perspective (see Bitcoin Bank) for every 1BTC you invest today you are guaranteed to have more than $30million USD in share value alone within 5 years if of course you do not sell your shares this is factoring in the rate of growth of Blaze Power Technology thus for every 1BTC or more you invest now you are a guaranteed millionaire in 5 years. Checkout both websites and have an open mind do not miss out like those caught sleeping in the early days of Microsoft when people laughed at Bill Gates when he stated that software would outsell hardware when it comes to computing, this then is one of those moments thus this is the time to get in your chance, it&#x27;s not too late. Spread the word and let us make a difference business wise &amp; conscious. Visit YouTube and keyword FUKUSHIMA danger 2016 you are also saving the world &amp; making a big difference. You are not safe as long as Nuclear reactors still exist this is your chance to make a mega profit &amp; save the world at the same time. Before you get skeptical take a look at what famous individuals in history said (as pointed out by a savvy investor at Bitcoin Bank) and quote:<p>“The horse is here to stay, but automobiles are only a novelty, a fad.” Horace Rackham, 1903<p>“Rock &amp; Roll will be gone by June” Variety Magazine 1955<p>“Remote shopping while entirely feasible will flop” Time Magazine 1968<p>“Television will not last. It is a flash in the pan.” Mary Summerville 1948<p>“Next Christmas, the I-Pod will be dead, finished, gone, kaput.” Alan Sugar 2005<p>“There is no likelihood man can tap the power of the atom.” Robert Millikan, 1923<p>“The telephone has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication.” William Horton 1876<p>“I predict the internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.” Robert Metcalf 1995<p>“The cinema is little more than a fad.” Charlie Chaplin 1916<p>“The idea that calvarly will be replaced with these iron coaches is absurd.” Field Marchsall Haig, 1916 talking about the tank<p>“Fooling around with alternating current is just a waste of time. No one will ever use it.” Thomas Edison 1889<p>“I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.” — Thomas
Watson, chairman of IBM, 1943.<p>“There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home.” — Ken Olson, president, chairman and founder of Digital Equipment Corp., 1977.<p>PS*: An idea? Buy one of our Free Electricity Generators &amp; use them to power your rigs &amp; mine Bitcoin for free. We have the power!

But imo this is throwing the baby with the bathwater.<p>Go to Germany, download a movie either from the Pirate Bay or see one from one of the many illegal websites streaming content and prepare for a letter (delivered to your home address) with a huge fine and a legal threat within a month.<p>Not that I&#x27;m a huge fan of pirating content, even if some cases like Sci-Hub have the moral high grown, but this goes to show just how trustworthy an ISP is, in an EU country with some of the best privacy laws ... and in such cases a VPN is absolutely mandatory.<p>---<p>DoH hides your DNS queries — if you visit an HTTPS website, the traffic might be protected via HTTPS, but the domain name is clearly seen.<p>Of course, the ISP still sees the IP you&#x27;re communicating with, but due to SNI and industry practices nowadays of putting websites behind CDNs, IPs don&#x27;t necessarily reveal the website you&#x27;re communicating with.<p>DoH also makes it harder for ISPs to block or redirect your access to certain websites. For instance it makes it harder to block Pirate Bay based on the whims of your local government. Now certainly Cloudflare can also be compelled to block websites like Pirate Bay, but the DoH service you&#x27;re communicating with is customizable, you can pick whatever service you want and just like VPNs, I predict there will be plenty of privacy respecting services to choose from.<p>And DoH is not foolproof, it doesn&#x27;t solve all of our privacy needs, it&#x27;s just a piece of the puzzle, but a necessary one.",,bad_user,,1582704684,2020-02-26T08:11:24Z,comment,22421309,22421104,,,

,,"Note: I&#x27;m in the US, so my left lane is for passing, my right lane is for cruising&#x2F;exiting. If you drive in another country, your sides may vary.<p>If your recommendation is that everyone travel at the same rate in all lanes of traffic, creating a rolling checkerboard pattern, I wish you luck. I predict that we won&#x27;t see this behavior until humans don&#x27;t drive the cars anymore. The closest thing in real life, with human drivers of all temperaments and motivations, is a traffic jam. If even one person wants or needs to travel more rapidly (or more slowly) than the mesh, the clash of priorities, expectations, and behaviors can create a dangerous situation.<p>If we assume that human drivers are not uniform in needs, motivations, skills, and equipment, then we can assume that their desired speeds may vary. In this circumstance, we should arrange the rules of the road such that all drivers are predictable and can navigate the roadway in a safe and efficient manner. So far, this is done by telling slow traffic to stay right, unless they must change left to pass someone slower* . Exits are typically on the right, so the slow can always transact with exits without having to change lanes. If someone fast wants to exit, they simply match speed with the right lane, change right, and exit. Everyone is predictable, Everyone knows what to expect from everyone else, and as such hazards are sparse. Imagine a sand dune on a treadmill in a heavy wind. The bulk of the sand moves steadily along (bottom of dune = right lane), but the grains that want to move faster due to wind (top of dune = left lane) bypass the glut and blow over the top of it. This evens out the dune into a flatter hill, then into a long, low rise. The dune treadmill can fit into a smaller tunnel after a long time of faster grains passing the slower grains. As grains pass, they recycle down to allow faster grains to pass. This theory should allow for the most efficient flow of traffic in a multilane system.<p>In such a system, if you have a car going slowly in the middle or left lane, the system becomes less predictable. The faster cars have to slow to avoid them, and may not be able to change left to pass due to faster cars. If there&#x27;s room, they can pass right, but that&#x27;s not a common situation, it&#x27;s not what people expect, and it&#x27;s therefore risky. This obstruction has the effect of slowing down the entire system, creating a rolling road block, and eventually a traffic jam as everyone following has to react to the obstruction and find a way around it. Hazards are high in such a situation. Traffic can&#x27;t flow like water around the obstruction. One driver has made the roadway less safe and efficient for all.<p>I&#x27;m not interested in downvoting you, this is good discussion. However, although maximum throughput is theoretically achieved when all cars are uniformly traveling at a high rate of speed in a mesh, there are several factors that cause this to be an untenable ruleset right now. If someone on the left has to exit, problems begin. If someone is in a hurry, or can&#x27;t keep up, or is limited in speed by equipment, law, or regulation, traffic begins. If any traffic begins to take effect, it rapidly compounds into a slower mesh in the best case, and a traffic jam in more realistic situations.<p>In all situations, the frequency of exits is inversely correlated to the efficiency of transit.<p>*: Whether the right lane is entitled to change lanes left, or must wait for an oncoming faster car to go by, varies. In the US, if the car can get in the next lane safely, they&#x27;re legal. In Germany, if they cause a car to have to slow down for them, they&#x27;re illegal. I favor the German system, as it forces awareness and has less reactivity, which can be hazardous. My personal rule is to never merge, turn, or change lanes if someone else will have to react to me in any way. It is infuriating when someone turns from a secondary road with barely enough time to get their car into the lane before I would have hit them if I hadn&#x27;t braked.<p>TL;DR your anticipation of the proposed policy being derided was correct, and such derision is merited both from a safety and an efficiency standpoint. When machines are handling transit, it may become a more feasible solution, but that time is not now.",,_archon_,,1495641413,2017-05-24T15:56:53Z,comment,14410955,14406092,,,

I predict the performance is going to be worse than something which allows (almost) all characters, because of validation overhead.<p>More seriously, I wrote a full grammar based parser engine for Biopython along these lines. The Achilles heel was error recovery. Suppose record #123456 in a database contains a syntax error (I can list dozens I found, like a copyright date of 19995 breaking my four-digit definition, or SWISS-PROT record with the copyright lines in the wrong spot.) How do I have the parser ignore that record, report the problem, and continue parsing with the next record?<p>Error recovery in context free grammars is hard, but doable.<p>Then how do I say that &quot;if the ID is XYZ and the version number is 12 then use this work-around because that release had a bug which has since been fixed&quot;?

  def show_me():
      caller = sys._getframe(1)
      f_code = caller.f_code

      a = &quot;%s %s %s&quot; % (x, y, z)
      show_me()

I&#x27;ve been looking at various style transfer techniques, and having something a bit more plug &amp; play will help me focus on the more unique parts. I predict that we&#x27;ll see more celebrity voices used as conversational interfaces become more common.<p>Part of the complexity is going from &#x27;context-free phonemes&#x27; to actually modeling personality. Having some way for the voice to know how to embed emotion, and ideally contextually from the sentences themselves. NeNe is an interesting example as she adds so many non-verbal sounds to her dialog (bleeps and bloops and eye rolls that she translates into affected speech). That&#x27;s part of what makes her NeNe, and a big part of the entertaining value. Pursuing that is what will bring style transfer to the next level... total personality emulation.

,,"This is a rehash of a previous post of mine regarding electricity consumption:<p>Back in the days where all our electricity came from fossil fuels, I completely agree that marginal electricity usage was bad for the environment. However I think that thought has persisted with us even though it is no longer true 100% of the time.
With renewables sometimes the marginal cost of electricity to our environment is near 0 or even negative (eg, during periods of higher winds and lower demand.)<p>I predict that in the future as bitcoin mining becomes more and more of an efficiency game that you will see bitcoin mining be kind of a load balancer the grid, effectively turning off during peak demand (or low supply) times and contributing to the base load during regular times.<p>For example, it may even help the economics of building new wind plants. Eg, currently it may not be profitable to build a new wind plant because base load is too low that the excess power generated would need to be sold off at 0 or even negative prices. However if bitcoin mining could be turned on during these times and off during periods of high demand, there will need to be fewer peaker plants in operation and it would positively affect the economics of opening a new wind plant.<p>Bitcoin mining only cares about the cost of electricity at a given time, it is not like most other electricity demands that are very time based. With the large variance of electricity generation by renewables, I think bitcoin can in the future help smooth demand according to the real supply&#x2F;demand curve.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like a different implementation of the Tesla utility grid batteries. Instead of deploying power, you force the grid to build more renewable capacity (that the miners are paying for) that you use except in peak periods, where you turn off and effectively provide the grid with more power.",,yrral,,1610580658,2021-01-13T23:30:58Z,comment,25769495,25769131,,,
,,"systemd is great. I used it successfully for operations on many projects that I ran. It provides the standardized way to reliably run and manage services on a single machine. I also agree with opponents that shell was the de facto standard way to orchestrate things, allowing you to go from dev to prod without significant changes. I was a fan of runit as a process manager before systemd took over the space.<p>That said there is a problem when you want to run things on multiple machines. What then? Unix and systemd were not designed as an OS for machine clusters, even though it won&#x27;t be hard to imagine the concepts to be stretched even to this realm.<p>The docker&#x2F;kubernetes crowd has been targeting the multi-machine OS scene much sooner and better, even though the solution of let&#x27;s pack all dependencies, the entire machine and then some to a fat package and then have it run by a scheduler complex as f seems not like the ultimate future of the space.<p>I took a look at Nomad as a replacement for Kubernetes, which is much much simpler and you can get up and running with a single binary within 2 hours using this tutorial [0]. Nomad supports not only docker as a backend, but you can run  raw_exec backend as well - that is any binary, such as shell script, that you wish to run without packaging the entire world with it. Now imagine if only you could schedule to run systemd units using Nomad. You&#x27;d scale from a single machine OS to cluster OS just like that.<p>I predict that Kubernetes will NOT be the ultimate answer as many are hoping for, betting their careers on it. It is too complex and not supporting other than docker runtimes makes it much inferior product than Nomad. Simple solutions usually win ultimately, so Nomad or systemd extended for multi machine services or even just vanilla linux process management extended to cluster level seem like much saner approaches.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;hashicorp-engineering&#x2F;hashicorp-nomad-from-zero-to-wow-1615345aa539"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;hashicorp-engineering&#x2F;hashicorp-nomad-fro...</a>",,snidane,,1615869130,2021-03-16T04:32:10Z,comment,26473044,26472740,,,

,,"&gt; Ways to cut down a huge part of heating-related needs are known, for example by enhancing thermal isolation or heating buildings in &quot;anti-frost&quot; (no freezing) mode while wearing heated clothing.<p>Building standards for new buildings are aleady very strict when it comes to isolation.<p>But I don&#x27;t think you understand the mentality of most Norwegians on this matter. Norway produces electricity at extremely low prices. This is 110% renewable. Most Norwegians don&#x27;t feel obligated to reduce their quality of life just ot provide cheaper electricity to Denmark, Germany and the UK.<p>If you take commodities where the price difference is the reverse, like meat, (EDIT:) I expect most Danes would be equally reluctant to pay Norwegian prices for beef and pork.<p>In fact, Norway fully intends for people to INCREASE their electricity consumption, even beyond what we currently export. Much of Norway&#x27;s greenhouse gas emmisions come from petrol&#x2F;diesel, but currently 2&#x2F;3 of new cars are electric. This means that ever more electricity is needed domestically.<p>As long as most European countries use natural gas for heating, or rather, as long as natural gas is a cheaper way to heat buildings in countries like Germany than electricity, I predict that it will be hard to have a common electricity market across the North Sea &#x2F; Skagerak. If electricity is not used for heating, it is kind of a luxery good. But when all you have for heating is electricity, it becomes a fundamental need, similar to food and water (when it&#x27;s -40 degrees Celsius outside).<p>Many countries in Eastern Europe have winter temperatures almost similarly low, and for those to use electricity for heating, the price also needs to be at similar levels (or lower, since they have less wealth than Norway).<p>For many of those countries, it&#x27;s hard replace fossil fuels, and if they cannot use Russian gas, they may have to go back to coal (LNG may be too expensive).<p>Hopefully you&#x27;re right, and they can get affordable prices by using windmills. But for countries like Hungary and Romania to be able to heat their houses with electricity, prices have to be RADICALLY lower than current prices in Germany or Denmark.<p>Obviously, modern nuclear plants are not cheap enough in all places, either. But even if the effect is just that using Nuclear in place of gas for electricity production, that should ensure that (non-Russian) natural gas remains viable for heating purposes througout Europe for the next generation.<p>Or (admittedly a bit unrealistic), one could revise standards for Nuclear production to lower safety standards (in terms of expected deaths per GWh) to a level more similar to competing energy forms.",,trashtester,,1654072247,2022-06-01T08:30:47Z,comment,31579450,31578829,,,

The prophecy, as explained by Jesus 2000 years ago, is that God either creates Heaven on Earth!!!, or ends the world and creates New Earth and New Heaven.&#60;p&#62;God says that he will fix amputees, the hard of hearing, the blind, in the bible.

It&#x27;s slow going.  I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll see that bill this month.  Presumably, after that bill was delayed last year, he then directed the DOJ to go to court over these issues with Apple.  I predict that fails.<p>The President has already alluded to the future in his remarks at SXSW.  In his view, after the next terrorist attack, Congress will rush through legislation and it will be ugly.<p>At that point, we will be depending largely on the public&#x27;s understanding of computer technology and encryption so that we can respond with an even hand.  If people support encryption and let their representatives know, then we are good.  But if they remain uninformed, there is a possibility that they will feel passing an anti-encryption bill would make them safer from terrorism.<p>Let&#x27;s examine a possible future where the case is won by Apple and in the future there is a terrorist attack that used encryption to accomplish its goals.<p>What will happen?  Will law enforcement point the finger at technologists?  Will they claim we enabled the attack by blocking legislation that, in their view, would have solved the &quot;going dark&quot; problem they claim they face?<p>Further, how will the public respond?  There is <i>still</i> currently 42% of the population who believes the government should be able to compel Apple to write software, which they do not want to write, that aids the FBI [2].<p>The clock is ticking.  We don&#x27;t know how much time we have to educate the public about encryption until the next terrorist attack.  In my view, we need to,<p>1. seek out public figures and media who can share our message
2. come up with more concise messaging that is understandable by a non-techie
3. back it up with facts and primary sources<p>John Oliver is not enough.  All the tech companies is not enough.  This is as big as or bigger than SOPA.  When we fought SOPA, we didn&#x27;t have the possibility that people could blame us in the future for terrorist attacks if that bill did not pass.  If and when we fight an anti-encryption bill, we will be fighting that alarmist view.

I am sure TPG and Avaya bondholders wished things had turned out better on this investment. But they made an active investment decision, in a risky company, as part of a diversified portfolio of multiple bets similar (well hopefully). The portfolio overall also hopefully isn&#x27;t losing money even when one of the deals turns out to be a dud. Companies can go down even when giving a 100% honest effort to improve it. Look at VCs and startups, some&#x2F;most startups in the VC&#x27;s portfolio inevitably fail, are these companies and their VCs losers? If people are fully informed on the risk and rewards, and nothing was taken away, then the founders, employees and investors knew they were taking a risk when they signed up.<p>My main concern when I read news stories like this is if people were lied to, or misled or company directors &amp; officers did not act in good faith while making decisions when running the company. Being dumb still not a crime on its own.

I'm now starting a company, doing all the backend development too, thanks to Ruby on Rails.

This person strikes me as an ally to our cause (yours and mine), one that is thinking out loud about the psychology of those in our society who choose to downgrade the priority of addressing climate change. Analyzing and understanding the psychology of an opponent is not the same as agreeing with it. It is a necessary prerequisite to convincing your opponent of the truth.

Or should we split our resources between stopping deforestation and ceasing the use of fossil fuels? Since we have limited time and resources, how should we split? 80&#x2F;20% in favor of deforestation? Should we leave any time and money to other world problems like pandemics? Poverty? How much?

,,"I joined Uber in 2016, right around when on every conference you&#x27;d hear a talk along the lines on &quot;Lessons learned at Uber on scaling to thousands of microservices&quot; [1].<p>After a year or two, those talks stopped. Why? Turns out, having thousands of microservices is something to flex about, and make good conference talks. But the cons start to weigh after a while - and when addressing those cons, you take a step back towards fewer, and bigger services. I predict Monzo will see the same cons in a year or two, and move to a more pragmatic, fewer, better-sized services approach that I&#x27;ve seen at Uber.<p>In 2020, Uber probably has fewer microservices than in 2015. Microservices are fantastic for autonomy. However, that autonomy also comes with the drawbacks. Integration testing becomes hard. The root cause of most outages become parallel deployments of two services, that cause issues. Ownership becomes problematic, when a person leaves who owned a microservice that was on the critical path. And that no one else knew about. Oncall load becomes tough: you literally have people own 4-5 microservices that they launched. Small ones, sure, but when they go down, they still cause issues.<p>To make many services work at scale, you need to solve all of these problems. You need to introduce tiering: ensuring the most ciritical (micro)services have the right amount of monitoring, alerting, proper oncall and strong ownership. Integration testing needs to be solved for critical services - often meaning merging multiple smaller services that relate to each other. Services need to have oncall owners: and a healthy oncall usually needs at least 5-6 engineers in a rotation, making the case for larger services as well.<p>Microservices are a great way to give more autonomy for teams. Just beware of the autonomy turning into something that&#x27;s hard to manage, or something that burns people out.

It makes evolution like a huge parallel computer instead of like lots of small, very slow serial computers.<p>If you examine asexual reproduction: you get a ""tree of evolution"".  Each node in that tree is slightly ""more evolved"" than its parent on average (natural selection prunes the devolved ones more than the evolved ones).<p>However, each branch in the tree has to evolve every single feature independently from its sibling branches. You only inherit evolutionary enhancements of your own ancestors.<p>Assuming a tree of depth N: each node in the tree has only O(N) ancestors, and thus, about O(N) evolution experienced in each node.<p>With sexual reproduction, you also recombine the evolutionary advancements of two ancestors into new nodes. It is no longer a tree, but a DAG of nodes (Directed Acyclic Graph).  Each node now has O(2^depth) ancestors.  Evolution can recombine features that took a long time to develop into a new baseline, and evolve from there.<p>This is an <i>exponential</i> increase in evolution speed -- and I believe that is so incredibly huge of an advancement, that I predict that even species we believe are incapable of sexual reproduction, are probably sexually reproducing (e.g: exchanging DNA in some way) because it is too huge of an advantage to give up.<p>Lastly, I find that it is interesting that there's a similarity between sexual-based evolution process to one of the frameworks we use for parallel computing: ""Map/Reduce"". Take a single node in the tree, and just ""Map"" (mutate &#38; select) over it multiple times, you get slightly better nodes.

,,"I can see this being big, It makes me wonder about the very long term.<p>Saying that it&#x27;s a tool meant to be used by lawyers is fine, but it&#x27;s going to be fairly obvious to any lawyer who thinks about it for a moment that that is basically bullshit.<p>The play is pretty obvious:<p>Phase 1: Lawyers use the service as a workflow tool.<p>Phase 2: The tool gets good enough to mostly not need the lawyers. They enjoy a brief period in which their income is essentially automated.<p>Phase 3: Companies use the service as a lawyer, lawyers only used in extraordinary circumstances.<p>A big part of the lawyer&#x27;s value proposition is about liability&#x2F;peace of mind. Like, &quot;I&#x27;m sure this NDA is solid because if it&#x27;s not I have someone to sue, the guy who wrote it, my lawyer.&quot; That&#x27;s a valuable service, which is why they will stay in the picture during phase 3--essentially a liability limiting sign off.<p>Im sure you&#x27;ve thought about that, as your business model sort of hinges on having the lawyer take all the liability. Ie, the documents you provide are just &quot;suggestions&quot; or boilerplate for a professional to base their work off of, and those professionals are the ones who are actually liable for mistakes or oversights. It makes sense.<p>(Sidenote: I predict some hostility from lawyers here, similar to the hostility in the design profession over stuff like 99designs. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll matter though. They will be hostile because they know that the tool, if it becomes widespread, would drastically reduce the number of lawyers who can work in the area, but they will each be incentivized to use the tools individually because it&#x27;ll save them time in their practice as they all race for the bottom, hoping that they are one of the few left standing in the aftermath.)<p>Anyway, you&#x27;ll have access to a very large dataset of those potential mistakes and oversights plus the tactics that work to solve them, and you&#x27;ll be able to hone the tool so that they become more and more rare (this is phase 2 from above).<p>But the thing I wonder about is what the second order effects will be. Let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re in a world in which Ironclad has won, and millions of businesses use it for the legal needs.<p>In that world you have drastically fewer lawyers handling more clients because the work is essentially automated and they are sign signing off. Each lawyer probably still makes the same money overall since the revenue per client is much lower.<p>At some point something will go wrong, and the lawyer will be on the hook for having screwed up. And he&#x27;ll say &quot;Wait a minute, I&#x27;m not the one who screwed up. I used the Microsoft of legal services, the one you can&#x27;t get fired for choosing, the huge goliath that lowly me could never hope to question because they have the most legal expertise in the world. I used Ironclad. They said this document was right, who am I to say otherwise? I trusted them, and they are the ones who screwed up.&quot;<p>And at first it won&#x27;t matter. That&#x27;s not how professional liability works, so that lawyer will get ground up in the gears. Maybe the scrappy ones will sue you, and you&#x27;ll take your knocks, mostly winning or settling.<p>But I wonder if maybe when there&#x27;s an army of rubber stampers who are essentially not doing anything except saying &quot;If Ironclad screwed up this document, then I&#x27;ll take the fall,&quot; then with enough case law the environment will change, and somehow Ironclad actually would be saddled with a greater proportion of the liability? Normally I imagine things like that wouldn&#x27;t work because no one will fight enough to place the liability where it probably belongs, but in this case you&#x27;ll be up against LAWYERS, whose profession it is to deal with and fight for&#x2F;against laws. That might make a difference in the very long term.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;d be a good problem to have since it would mean you won like 20 years ago.

I would be curious to see actual dealer surveys about why people are purchasing upgrades, because I&#x27;m betting its a case of, someone wants the leather, and they end up buying the fancy infotainment system to get it. As I mentioned elsewhere, no one uses those systems except as bluetooth handsets these days, and just about everyone I know thinks they are garbage. They are the modern equivalent of a CD player in a car and the automobile manufactures just haven&#x27;t noticed.

It may seem easy, but it requires a lot of thought.<p>(To back up a bit: Image augmentations are how you solve that problem. &quot;How do I make my model robust across different cameras?&quot; It might be tempting to gather labeled data from a variety of cameras, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily result in a model that can handle newer, larger-res cameras.

If anything, I predict a different sort of confabulation: that we have managed come up with a scientific theory to something that is provably impenetrable to hard scientific quantitative theory. I have every faith in our ability to convince ourselves that we can somehow use math (and data) to beat math.<p>Is there a data-driven religion being born? It would be one that believes that anything not quantifiable is not worth knowing, and would try to plug any missing holes in our knowledge with data and quantitative theory, even if that&#x27;s mathematically impossible.<p>Hell, just the other day I had a discussion with some people on Reddit who believed we could somehow beat the Halting Theorem or, at least, make it irrelevant in practice. But just like we&#x27;ll likely never write a computer program that can fully reason about other computer programs, we will probably never be able to explain human history enough to make definitive explanations&#x2F;predictions on most things. I am perfectly OK with that. I am also well aware that <i>not</i> being OK with that, and trying to beat the odds is how (some -- not all) progress is made :)",,pron,,1427165298,2015-03-24T02:48:18Z,comment,9254618,9254372,,,

Yet we live in a time where we don&#x27;t need a PhD program to receive education from the likes of Ng, LeCun and Langford.

Nowadays, you do not need to be a certified DBA to set up a database. It is helpful and in some cases heavily advisable, but databases now see a much wider adoption by laypeople. This is starting to happen in ML. I think more hobbyists are right now toying with convolutional neural networks, than there are serious researchers in this area. These hobbyists can surely find and contribute valuable practical insights.<p>Tuning parameters is basically a gridsearch. You can bruteforce this. In goes some ranges of parameters, out come the best params found. Fairly easy to explain to a programmer.<p>Adapting existing algorithms is ML researcher territory. That is a few miles above the business people extracting valuable&#x2F;actionable insight from (big or small or tedious) data. Also there is a wide range of big data engineers making it physically possible to have the &quot;necessary&quot; PhD&#x27;s extract value from Big Data.",,blauwbilgorgel,,1413902125,2014-10-21T14:35:25Z,comment,8487526,8486191,,,

,,"For decentralized social media to happen, there needs to be sufficient motive to leave centralized platforms collectively within a cohesive <i>network</i> of individuals, so that if a tipping point is met to overcome activation costs, most of the network will move over so the new decentralized platform has similar value to the old centralized platform that the network was previously on. A few incentivized individuals in a wider network of apathetics won&#x27;t work -- it needs to be a cohesive network all switching together in order for the value to remain competitive with the old platform, due to Metcalfe&#x27;s law. And since we&#x27;re talking about decentralization, the network transitioning will ideally be incentivized to choose a decentralized network to migrate to, vs another centralized one (even though the usability and quality of experience on the decentralized one is likely to be inferior.) This combination of factors is what makes it so difficult to bootstrap these networks.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing: there is such an opportunity now, if anyone is willing to take it. Conservatives in the US are outraged against perceived censorship and de-platforming by centralized social media platforms. Regardless of the validity, there&#x27;s a deep seated hatred of these platforms forming and an incredible sense of urgency to move elsewhere. Since the motivation for leaving is overcoming centralized control, this audience is particularly attracted to accepting decentralized platforms. Given that approximately half of the US aligns partially with the views of some of these voices, this is a large potential network. The catch is that we are also living in an era where if someone develops and delivers such a solution for this market, they&#x27;re going to be under vicious attack and be labelled as sympathizers to the extremist, minority voices of that audience. Most likely their careers will be destroyed by choosing to build for such an audience, regardless of how much the extremist voices are actually present on the decentralized platform.<p>I predict that if we are ever going to see a decentralized social media platform emerge for any of these services, it will begin with a critical mass of marginalized voices who have been censored and de-platformed, and their audience, moving to it. Instead of beginning as a &quot;toy&quot;, it will begin as a &quot;place for undesirables.&quot; Today that could mean conservative voices in the US, tomorrow it could mean something else. If the network is able to garner sufficient growth, over time, as it always goes, the nature of the &quot;average user&quot; will be diluted away so the network is no longer perceived as a community of like-minded individuals but instead as a general, global platform. (Similar how most mainstream global social network sites today began in a similar way: Twitter was for techies, Facebook was for college kids, etc.)<p>Look out for these leading edge behaviors, and don&#x27;t just dismiss them if the early adopter audience has the perception of being unsavory to you. It seems somewhat inductive that, given the current existence of the global centralized platforms, any long-run successful decentralized platform likely could not start any other way than with groups of people who both want to leave collectively, and who will get no benefit from staying (in other words, the people on centralized platforms will all want them to leave too.)",,gfodor,,1561908000,2019-06-30T15:20:00Z,comment,20318658,20316140,,,

Languages which aim for usability first (like Python and Ruby), which use bigints by default, and languages which aim for performance first (like C++ and Swift), which use fixints by default.  It&#x27;s even somewhat similar with strings: the Rubys and Pythons of the world use Unicode everywhere, even though it&#x27;s slower.  No static limits.<p>With real numbers, we&#x27;re in a weird middle ground where every language still uses fixnums by default, even those which aim for usability over performance, and which don&#x27;t have any other static limits encoded in the language.  It&#x27;s a strange inconsistency.<p>I predict that in 10 years, we&#x27;ll look back on this inconsistency the same way we now look back on early versions of today&#x27;s languages where bigints needed special syntax.",,ken,,1546754116,2019-01-06T05:55:16Z,comment,18836811,18832526,,,

,,"&gt;Unemployment is _good_. Being poor is bad. They are only correlated because we decided that made sense in the past. It doesn&#x27;t any more.<p>The way I see it, the idea behind basic income in a largely capitalist society would be to make being poor a lot less bad.   It&#x27;d still be bad, probably, as a lot of us like having nice stuff; we like living in desirable areas, and those things won&#x27;t be available to people on basic income, assuming we continue to use markets to distribute those scarce goods.<p>Those of us who come from middle class families who maintain good family relationships often have a similar option; crashing with mom and dad for a while.  It&#x27;s not really something you want to do for any length of time, but it&#x27;s nice to know that if things really go south, you aren&#x27;t homeless, and you don&#x27;t have to do anything truly repugnant.<p>But just like crashing with mom and dad, it&#x27;s not really a desirable long-term option for most of us.   Sure, sure, it&#x27;s going to be better than the jobs that are the worst on the unpleasantness&#x2F;compensation scale, and I predict would dramatically drive up wages in the least pleasant fields, (and I predict would lower the rates of the less remunerative forms of crime for money)   but if you are a software developer or something, especially if you come from a middle-class family that you maintain ties to,  a realistically-sized basic income isn&#x27;t really going to change your motivation.<p>Point being, unemployment (as usually defined in statistics, meaning people who want work but can&#x27;t get it)  will remain a bad thing, and assuming a realistically sized basic income, most people who currently work are going to want to continue working.<p>And... this is important.  We need people to continue working.   The basic income choice is really, &quot;do we want people to do really unpleasant jobs for not very much money?&quot;    and then &quot;are we all willing to pay rather a lot to make it so that people don&#x27;t have to do really unpleasant jobs for not very much money?&quot;<p>The argument in favor is the idea that if a job really is that unpleasant, it ought to be compensated for that unpleasantness, and effort ought to be put into automating that job away.   Making workers less desperate would make those things happen.  Making workers less desperate would also decrease the workforce participation rate.   More people wouldn&#x27;t work, and more people would work part time.<p>The argument against is that this is going to be pretty expensive, both in terms of what we have to pay to get the difficult-to-automate unpleasant jobs done, and in terms of just the taxes that would be required to fund the scheme.",,lsc,,1456003439,2016-02-20T21:23:59Z,comment,11142024,11141251,,,

,,"This will not be corrected.<p>In an article about a position in which 1 in 50 employees is a man, the article includes the line &quot;Across Google, women make up only 31% of employees.&quot;<p>There are many, many tech jobs where almost all the qualified people are men (think high end security, really low level packet optimisation stuff, pretty much any extreme fringe skill). That means to address the 31% figure company wide, tech giants need to fiddle with the numbers in jobs where it is not mission critical, e.g. you can&#x27;t get to 50% in security, but you can make sure that 100% of the cleaners are women. Of course, this discriminates against under-skilled men and massively exacerbates the gender pay disparity internally, but that is impossible to fix company wide whilst being defendable on a department by department basis (e.g. employees of position X irrespective of gender are paid equally), whereas the company wide ratio is fixable.<p>Here are some examples of measures that could fix the 31% company wide figure quoted, without touching pay disparity:<p>1. Hirings in non-essential roles are to approach 100% female - think cleaners, admin staff, low level accountants.<p>2. Hiring in roles that support the essential roles are to approach 75% female - I&#x27;m thinking here of CFO support staff, account managers, project managers, anyone who supports people writing code. Why 75%? Because there will be some really good men that you can&#x27;t afford to lose.<p>3. If a role is non-essential but predominantly male to the point an all female hiring policy is tough, just hypothetically here think garbage collection, outsource to another company. This removes these men form the headcount.<p>4. If a role is outsourced but could be 100% female hires, pre-school teachers is a great example, insource it.<p>5. Find ways to move more men from employee to contractor. This is a double win because while it massively inflates the unfixable wage disparity in real terms, i.e. what men are women are actually paid, it really changes the wage disparity on paper, while also fixing the 31% figure.<p>6. Create new divisions in separate entities whose numbers are not counted against Google employee numbers. Contractors on steroids.<p>I predict we will see big tech companies utilise some or all of these measures.<p>Last point on this, there are lots of ways to fix the wage disparity ON PAPER while making things in reality worse, and I fear these are coming as well. Most involve finding ways to better disguise male compensation - by changing it from salary to something else. More options, payments for extraneous things as a non-salary allowance (rent compensation, massive relocation fees, education allowances), pay higher bonus to salary percentages. That will be then end game here, sadly.",,T2_t2,,1515050373,2018-01-04T07:19:33Z,comment,16068603,16067134,,,

,,"This is going to be a disaster, Like GoT Season 8 level diaster. Mark my words. My reasoning:<p>1. The budget for the original LOTR trilogy was $281 million [1]. Obviously there&#x27;s inflation but we&#x27;re also talking film vs TV. Films tend to be much more expensive to produce to the point where only theatrical releases tend to make films economical;<p>2. The showrunners are JD Vance and Patrick McKay. If you check their IMDB profiles they have almost no credits. How on Earth did they get this job? To put this in context: films are run by directors. Producers work for the director. TV shows are run by showrunners, which are really producers. Directors work for the producers. There&#x27;s good reason for this. The showrunners need to maintain consistency across the entire season while individual episode directors will manage the schedule for their own episode.<p>Producers are writers and you&#x27;d expect that any producer has a long list of writing credits and a premium TV showrunner will have lots of producer and writer credits.<p>3. No name recognition in the actors that I can see. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with eelvating talented no name actors but you need to pepper in some name recognition. It builds hype and recognized actors tend to be recognized for a reason. GoT had Sean Bean and Peter Dinklage. There were also seasoned actors who just weren&#x27;t well known (eg Lena Headley);<p>4. A lot of shows go downhill when they run out of original material. It happened to GoT in apsectacular fashion. It happened to the Handmaid&#x27;s Tale (the book only covered Season 1). It takes a strong writing team to generate good original material. Being in Middle Earth is both a blessing and a curse. There is source material like the Silmarillion but that can also hamstring you in a way that greenfield writing isn&#x27;t.<p>5. Statements made suggest the showrunners and Amazon just don&#x27;t get the tone of Middle Earth, like they were trying to make GoT in Middle Earth. Not everything has to be GoT. Jackson understood LOTR. It&#x27;s why his vision was so good.<p>6. Spinoffs are hard. The most successful spinoffs are organic. Frasier (from Cheers) and Better Caul Saul (from Breaking Bad) spring to mind. Both came from a successfully developed character that was proven to audiences and thus also had inbuilt interest. HBO is busy throwing mud at the wall to see if any GoT spinoff will stick. Even now I&#x27;m not sure HBO has any idea of how badly D&amp;D shit the bed with GoT season 8. It undermined the interest in earlier seasons and nobody talks about GoT now. In seasons 3-5 they were actually showing episodes in theaters (even IMAX theaters). Think about that. Nobody cares about these spinoffs and D&amp;D are a big part of why. But they&#x27;re also not organic.<p>If you want to see what happens without strong leadership and understanding the source material, look at the Hobbit (yes Jackson was involved but he came in very late).<p>Amazon has committed $1 billion to this and I believe they are obligated to produce at least 5 seasons. I predict we&#x27;ll see 2 or even 3 different showrunners in that time and the whole thing will likely be incoherent.

,,"If you want to ""win"" then you must think about your achievements. Focusing on where you're being screwed keeps you being screwed.<p>In the last 20 years, Linux has taken over many domains. First servers. The big win that made Linux impossible to ignore. Ten years later a major shift to the userland was mobile: there are half a billion Android devices sold. Not to mention embedded systems. Meanwhile, Linux has also become <i>the way to build supercomputers</i>: the world's fastest supercomputers these days mean assembling huge Tesla GPU racks to run Linux.<p>While I do realize that secure boot can make Linux's life harder, I also realize that Linux per se isn't going anywhere or isn't attacked by Microsoft but general purpose computers are suffering from exhausted momentum. There are more and more devices that come with a preinstalled system, such as Android and iOS and the traditional desktop/laptop paradigm of buying hardware and installing whatever you want to run on it will continue to move into the marginal.<p>I predict that eventually it's the programmers who will be the only ones who exercise tasks of so varying nature that they need a more complex interface, something like what I'm using now. Most of the rest of people can manage with mostly touching a screen to use applications that offer a set of predefined capabilities, occasionally hooking up a keyboard.<p>The era of immutable operating systems with applications installable from a prefiltered app store is probably what actually works for most people. It's us programmers who long for the days when hardware was to be bought and software was to be written because we know that the lowest layer must always be there. For us, it was the very definition of a computer: programming hardware was all there ever was to computers. But most people don't need that.<p>Most people are perfectly <i>happy with an appliance</i>. They don't want to install updates or <i>manage their system</i>, they just click the power button and immediately continue from where they left the last time. They want an application and they tap it and it gets installed without clicking through a dozen pages of a helper wizard or aptitude install commands. And appliances such as tablets and phones and touchscreen laptops deliver a much better experience for non-programmers.<p>What we as programmers see as a bad thing is that programming will be removed farther from the end users. We all know how we started with playing games and ended up writing our own games because our computers allowed, and to an extent, suggested that. We would want to preserve that heritage to the future whizkids and future programmers. But that's still got a perspective bias: most people so far still haven't ""found it"" even if their computer would have allowed it. It's just us for which ""finding it"" was the revelation, and we know we would've ""found it"" anyway, somehow.<p>Maybe they'll be selling a limited stock of programmer's computers in ten years that are fully programmable. There's definitely a market for those because you can't write the nice appliances without a real programmers' computer. Maybe my grandkids will receive one of my old programmer's workstations from my work place, and use that deprecated hardware to teach themselves programming and find it a thousand times more interesting than playing games on their phones, much like my predecessors managed to hook themselves up with cheap nighttime computing time in a mainframe at their father's workplace and abused those cycles to write games to entertain themselves.",,yason,,1354728730,2012-12-05T17:32:10Z,comment,4877340,4876789,,,

,,"One trend that I notice is that most new languages focus their design on writability over readability. And by writability I mean prioritizing features that allow you to express more, while typing less code. These languages are specially prone to become &quot;brown languages&quot;.<p>One classic example is Perl. One of the killer aspects of Perl is that it allowed you to write in just one line or two what in other languages would take dozens of lines and boiler plate. Writing Perl is actually really nice. You could go from idea to working code extremely fast. And that&#x27;s why Perl became super popular two decades ago. However, maintaining a 100K LoC Perl website written by a lot of different people over 20 years, it&#x27;s definitely not a nice experience.<p>I know this is going to upset a lot of people, but another extreme example is Lisp. I think I&#x27;ve never seen any language as expressive as Lisp. Once you grasp it, writing Lisp is really really nice. However, reading a complex Lisp program using a ton of macros and a lot of higher order functions could be really hard. In my experience some of the hardest code to read that I have ever encountered has been written in Lisp. And if reading is hard, I don&#x27;t even want to talk about debugging. But okay, Lisp never really became super popular, so let&#x27;s ignore it for now.<p>One more modern example: Kotlin. Kotlin&#x27;s main improvements over Java are mostly on writability. Semantically, these languages are very similar. That&#x27;s kind of intentional, as one of the goals of Kotlin is maintaining a very good interoperability with Java. However, Kotlin is nicer to write than Java. Java is verbose, Kotlin is succinct. Kotlin adds a lot of syntax and features to make you write the same things that you would express in Java but in a much shorter way. Writing Kotlin is so much nicer than writing Java, I&#x27;m sure of that.<p>I recently started working on a large Kotlin code base, and I can say that reading Kotlin is harder than reading Java. It turns out that verbosity is not a problem when actually reading code. And having few ways of expressing things actually makes code easier to read.<p>Languages with a lot of features and different ways of doing things are easily abused. You can still write readable code in them, but it requires a lot more discipline. It&#x27;s so tempting to use that obscure language feature to make your code so succinct!<p>Python is a language that always put emphasis on readability. The developers of the language are famous for rejecting a lot of ideas to be added to the language. Even though Python is almost as old as Perl, so far, it has escaped from becoming a brown language and it&#x27;s still loved.  Who knows if it will remain like that.<p>Another language that seems very serious about this is Go. I know that there are a lot of Go haters here on HN, but you have to admit that Go designers put more emphasis on readability than writability. I predict that Go will escape from becoming a brown language.",,ceronman,,1619104610,2021-04-22T15:16:50Z,comment,26903684,26902821,,,

If an arbitrage bot is monitoring the pending block, it’ll be able to predict exactly how much the price will move on the next block.

The only remaining hurdle is the gas cost to add-&gt;remove liquidity (which on L2 will be virtually zero).<p>I really hope they beta test this, because it could potentially be disastrous.

Maybe two.<p>We're in year what? 9? of the iPod and yet the competition still isn't as slick. I see the same future for the iPad. There will be the iPad and ""the rest"".<p>As for Tim's arguments:<p>1. Phones aren't going away: agreed.<p>2. Pocket creep: disagree. I like the size of the iPhone 4. The 4""+ phones just seem a little too big;<p>3. 10"" for sharing: I don't really accept the premise. I view the iPad as a very personal (even intimate) computing device. Passing it back and forth isn't really what I'd call sharing. You can do that with anything you can pick up. Sharing I would view as two or more people looking at it at the same time;<p>4. 7"" for personal: disagree. Many people, myself include, love the size of the iPad. Eyesight comes into this as well, particularly for older users. 7"" to me fails the pocket test and (imho) the pocket test will be the differentiator in form factors.<p>Also regarding weight: on the couch it sits on your lap. When lying down you rest it on your chest. When at a desk or table it's on that surface. On a plane I rest my arm on the armrest or lap and hold the iPad. Basically I'm never holding it in the air. I believe this is a common ""beginner mistake"". It's natural but you quickly learn better. Another common error: holding it by it's edge rather than your hand underneath in the center of gravity, which is much much easier.<p>5. No bigger: agree.<p>6. Battery life: agree. It seems Apple will be the king of battery life for some time to come.<p>7. Cameras: disagree. Cameras work for PCs and notebooks because the position (at the top of the screen, typically) is eye level. In none of the aforementioned positions would a front facing camera be at a natural or flattering position. I'm not saying cameras won't be added but I don't think the use case is as compelling as some make out.<p>Basically, who wants to look up someone's nostrils?<p>As for rear cameras, the weight issue once again comes into play. No one wants to hold it up.<p>8. Creativity: creative people will do creative things on tablets. Uncreative people won't. It's really as simple as that. Frankly, I found the argument that the iPad is purely a consumption device to be condescending, even pretentious. I do agree that you won't see any serious programming done on tablets. You need a keyboard, mouse and large display for that.<p>9. Aspect ratio: I can't see these things going to 16:10 or 16:9. They simply don't have the height for it (I make the same argument when some people inexplicably buy 19"" widescreen monitors: they're letter boxes).<p>10. Games: tablets are great for these. I certainly play Angry Birds on my iPad.<p>Where I believe the Galaxy Tab really falls down is that <i>it seems</i> to be tied to carriers and a 2 year contract. That's a big fail right there and something the iPad got absolutely right.<p>Leaked prices also suggest it's $399... on a 2 year contract.",,cletus,,1286766014,2010-10-11T03:00:14Z,comment,1778631,1778274,,,
,,"&gt; Maybe I just expressed myself badly, so let my try again. I predict that Rocky Linux will not be a big success, and don&#x27;t think doing a free-beer RHEL clone (CentOS as most users understood it) is a worthwhile endeavor, despite a seemingly large audience. Yes, giving good stuff away for free is popular (and I do believe RHEL is a good product). Because they&#x27;re largely dependent on RH, who 1) appear not very enthusiastic about the idea of people running RHEL for free even without support, 2) can largely determine how expensive running a clone project will be. That&#x27;s why IMO it&#x27;s better to analyze if users really need a strict RHEL clone, or if what they want from it (xLTS, better tooling, commercial software compatibility, whatever) could be better developed on top of Debian, whose incentives seem to class less. People who really really need a RHEL clone: time to pay up or go with the Stream (it probably really not-so-bad).<p>&gt; Now unlike you I have zero inside knowledge or experience, so maybe I&#x27;m just talking out of my ass. But I am willing to make a somewhat falsifiable prediction, that Rocky and similar clone projects don&#x27;t have much chance of success. Maybe I&#x27;m all wrong and Rocky can with a handful of volunteers and some clever scripts, resurrect CentOS-as-people-understood-it. Or maybe some deep-pocket 3rd party with a better brand than Oracle will step up. We&#x27;ll find out a year or so.<p>So, let&#x27;s try this. I agree that Rocky will not be a big success, but completely because I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a major market demand for a RHEL clone in 2020. New deployments will end up being a container Linux distro with deployments inside VMs or containers. (RH)EL8 is relatively new with low-ish adoption. We still had customers on EL6 six months ago when I left. Institutional customers aren&#x27;t likely to move to EL8 until EL7 is nearing the end of phase 3 support, since the costs involved in reworking their applications to work (and their build&#x2F;config management toolchain to work with modularity+etc. This has nothing to do with Red Hat&#x27;s stance, which was (for the 7.5 years I was there, and still, from everyone I know who&#x27;s still there) very overtly pro-upstream.<p>Users don&#x27;t need a strict RHEL clone. They need a life raft until they can move to containers. It&#x27;s not worth re-training administrators how to use some other package ecosystem. Rocky will fail, but for these reasons",,evol262,,1608307947,2020-12-18T16:12:27Z,comment,25468451,25459010,,,

,,"The common sentiment has been that self-driving cars are just around the corner. The reality is quite different.<p>The remaining problems to solve such as navigating the elements or obeying construction signs or interacting properly with pedestrians or police are orders of magnitude more difficult than the problems that have been solved thus far. These problems are fundamentally different in that they can&#x27;t be solved by current AI techniques and vision algorithms. The progress made so far has been quick, but it relies on technology that Google has already mastered. We&#x27;d be mistaken to think that the remaining challenges will be solved as easily.<p>It&#x27;s a repeat of the classic mistake that has plagued the field of AI since the beginning: we underestimate the difficulty of problems that humans solve easily. We simply aren&#x27;t aware of the incredible complexity involved in our simplest decisions, such as pulling over to allow an ambulance to pass. This is simple right? Just slow down and move off to the side of the road. But when is it OK to move off to the side -- what if there is something in the way, what if a pedestrian didn&#x27;t expect you to move there, what if the car behind you suddenly gets in the way while it&#x27;s pulling over, what if you&#x27;re on a bridge, what if the ambulance behind you turned already and no one expects your car to suddenly pull over? Similar or more difficult problems arise when there&#x27;s debris or potholes in the road, other poor drivers, bad weather, jaywalkers, policemen giving orders, road work, detours, etc.<p>What you find is that the last 5 or 10 percent of the capability required to make self-driving cars feasible represents a category of problems which we don&#x27;t know how to solve, requiring a level of sophistication far beyond the current state of the art and perhaps approaching general intelligence in some cases (such as interpreting signs).<p>Better approaches involve shooting for more modest goals instead of full autonomy. Car companies are making investments in these more practical, incremental improvements, like automated parking and advanced cruise control.<p>But unlike car companies, Google isn&#x27;t in this game because it thinks it can make a profitable and successful product. Instead, it&#x27;s obvious that the main function of developing self-driving cars is as a PR tool (and the same goes for the rest of the Google-X projects). Google has gotten a lot of positive press for their self-driving cars, and they even use it to attract new employees.<p>However, I predict this positive press won&#x27;t last (this article being an early example) because people&#x27;s expectations are way too high. As years and years go by without much progress, Google&#x27;s self-driving cars will increasingly become a PR liability and will be compared to the promised flying cars of yesteryear.",,jahooma,,1409498890,2014-08-31T15:28:10Z,comment,8249505,8248546,,,

,,"&gt; If massive amounts of people move to electric vehicles gas prices will fall. This will make combustion vehicles more attractive.<p>If gas prices fall any lower due to demand, then production capacity will probably disappear permanently, leading to shortages and a huge, long-term rise in price.  Oil pumps aren&#x27;t like taps that can be shut off and powered back on demand.  They basically need to be operated continuously  because restarting them is pretty expensive.  And storing excess oil is also pretty expensive.<p>We also have to consider that low gas prices are due to volume.  Refinement is still costly, and if the volume of gas falls by a large amount, that refinement costs gets distributed among the remaining volume.  Refinement capacity is even more expensive to bring back online than pumps.<p>I predict gasoline production will death-spiral at some point.

,,"<i>I simply cannot, for the life of me, understand why people think that it&#x27;s their RIGHT to copy the works of others.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that hard to understand. The key is to realize that logic doesn&#x27;t drive behavior. Rather, people do what comes naturally – i.e. that which is habitual – and then rationalize it as needed. The rationalization process is very strong. Logic is a mere speedbump on that road.<p>The only time people think carefully through a course of action is if they have no habits to fall back on.<p>People pirate music because they&#x27;re habituated to think of music as free. The training process has been going on longer than digital music has existed, actually.<p>Which brings me to my observation that, of all the many dying forms of media, recorded music feels especially screwed. Yes, people pirate movies, books, and software, but somehow things seem a lot more dire among the poor musicians. Why is that?<p>I wonder if it&#x27;s just a perfect storm of coincidence. So many things about recorded pop music make it extra-susceptible to piracy.<p>* Until recently, music was designed to be learned and performed by other people. That was the only way to hear it more than once. So not only is there a centuries-old tradition of performing other people&#x27;s music, but there&#x27;s techniques and instruments based on that art and schools to teach you how.<p>People often did this by ear. There&#x27;s a story about Allegri&#x27;s <i>Miserere</i>, the subject of the most famous act of music piracy in history: The <i>Miserere</i> was the personal property of the Pope, and would-be copyists of the work were threatened with excommunication. For 150 years it was only performed in the Sistine Chapel during Holy Week. Then Mozart came to town at age 14, heard the piece at the Wednesday service, went back to his room and <i>wrote the whole thing down from memory</i>, came back on Friday night to listen again and make minor corrections, and gave the transcript away to be published.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miserere_(Allegri)"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Miserere_(Allegri)</a><p>It may seem obvious, but if we took any modern Mozart to see <i>Pacific Rim</i> no amount of talent would enable him to produce a reasonable cover version in a day. It would take a year and hundreds of millions of dollars. Memorizing and recopying a novel is much more achievable, but the result would not be impressive except as a stunt: It&#x27;s culturally understood that novels are intended to be printed verbatim, not reinterpreted or &quot;covered&quot;, and it would be clear to everyone that the copied version was &quot;plagiarism&quot;, not an homage or an interpretation. And many people are literally <i>blind</i> to features of a novel&#x27;s &quot;performance&quot;, such as its typesetting or the quality of its paper.<p>Novels were born in the age of cheap printing and are adapted to it. I predict that we will soon evolve genres of music that are similarly adapted to the era of cheap copying. It&#x27;s not a difficult prediction, because the selection pressure that will drive this trend is starkly obvious.<p>* It&#x27;s human nature to repeat the music that one hears. You can&#x27;t stop humming. Often even if you <i>want</i> to.<p>* There&#x27;s a tradition going back nearly a century of <i>pretending</i> that music is free: Music on the radio, and Muzak in stores. Of course, this music is all subsidized, but people don&#x27;t think about that, if they even know.<p>If I were David Lowery and someone handed me a time machine and a gun, of course I&#x27;d probably go back and shoot Hitler, like you do. But then I&#x27;d hunt down the inventor of Muzak. Because after two generations of being <i>marinated</i> in free music it&#x27;s no wonder people are habituated to think that music is free-as-in-oxygen.<p>* Pop music&#x27;s designers spent half a century promoting a culture of repeat listening, in order to encourage everyone to buy singles. So we&#x27;re trained to think of pop songs as something you <i>collect</i>, then listen to over and over. And we know that the best pop songs are the ones that are being heavily promoted, because being able to play &quot;the latest single&quot; is a fashion statement, even today.<p>Repeat-consumption of media is not some kind of natural law, it&#x27;s genre-specific. I&#x27;m a big re-reader, but I think I&#x27;m an odd case: The majority of people read books only once, which explains why, even if they do read, they don&#x27;t have a house full of books. Pauline Kael wrote about movies for a living, but never watched a movie more than once. And I have a huge Pinboard log of bookmarks, but I essentially never revisit them.<p>And, now that the money&#x27;s been sucked out of the market for &quot;original&quot; recordings by the &quot;original artists&quot;, there&#x27;s no reason why musical culture should continue to encourage playing the same thing twice. Many genres don&#x27;t: &quot;Never the same way twice&quot; pretty much <i>defines</i> jazz. (Unfortunately, jazz also evolved in an era awash with talented, classically-trained club and theater musicians, who eventually ran out of gigs because recording had been invented. The present and future of jazz is hip-hop and club music, built of improvised rhythm and rhyme instead of improvised melody and harmony, and of sampled recordings instead of sampled melodies and progressions.)",,mechanical_fish,,1373933689,2013-07-16T00:14:49Z,comment,6049331,6047978,,,

You can think of them as adolescence, mid-life, and rebirth.<p>The first pivot happens when the company is 5-8 years old (since the 1970s at least; older before then), and serves to define the company.  The System 360 for IBM, defining it as <i>the</i> provider of mainframes for enterprises.  MS-DOS for Microsoft, defining it as <i>the</i> dominant PC OS.

Mobile for Facebook, defining it as <i>the</i> service that connects people regardless of where they are.<p>The second pivot happens when the company is 10-15, at the height of its dominance, and usually results from it entering the hottest new technology wave with a vengeance.  It looks like it succeeds for a while, crushes early entrants, serves to legitimize that technology wave, but ultimately peters out as the company can&#x27;t keep up with the changes that it introduces.  The IBM PC for IBM, which legitimized the PC market but ultimately fell to clones.  Internet Explorer for Microsoft, which legitimized the Internet but ultimately was eclipsed by Google&#x27;s many products.  The Newton for Apple, which legitimized the PDA market but ultimately was too early.  Google+ for Google, which legitimized social networking but ultimately failed to gain traction.<p>The third pivot is when the company realizes that they basically incapable of innovating, and returns to the roots they established with the first pivot to live out their old age.  Open-source consulting for IBM, leveraging their massive installed base of enterprise customers.  VS Code, XBox, and Azure for Microsoft, recognizing that they are fundamentally a platforms company.  The iPhone and iPad for Apple, refocusing on their strengths in UX and delivering top-quality consumer electronics products.  Alphabet for Google, realizing that they&#x27;re fundamentally a conglomerate that lets a thousand flowers bloom (and cancels 990 of them).<p>Libra is Facebook&#x27;s second pivot.

Not just the intrusiveness of the update mechanism, but the breakage of compatibility and UI habituation are also cited as reasons.<p>Yes, these problems exist in Chrome as well as Firefox.

As driverless cars take the streets, then that marketplace will become a single-sided need for a service. This service (transportation) with driverless cars is just a simple utility measured against: price, quality and reliability. These are the same quality measures we use for electricity, gas, water, etc.<p>I can see an open-market in the future where anyone can buy a driverless car and add it to this open-market much in the same way that we can generate electricity and feed it back into the grid.<p>I predict the power of future transportation will then fall in the hands of the manufacturers of such cars, and not the market makers (i.e.: Uber).<p>What are your predictions for 2026?

She also worked some of her professional time on cases where the clients did not have to pay, a practice that is common in the legal industry, called &quot;pro bono.&quot;<p>Engineering: There are a wide variety of student and volunteer activities that are well-supported by professional engineers on a volunteer basis. For example one of my coworkers volunteers his time evenings and weekends to help &quot;coach&quot; a high school robotics team. And you may have heard of various other engineering challenges like popsicle stick bridges or egg drop competitions.<p>Medical: Several friends have transitioned into working in the medical field through free opportunities, primarily by volunteering with local rescue squads and first responder teams. These teams are typically supported&#x2F;led by some folks with professional medical training, but anyone can show up, volunteer their time, and get medical training.<p>Ultimately, to work in these fields professionally, folks need to get a credential of some kind, and that might cost money.

,,"&gt; <i>Value is not a function of rarity.</i><p>They&#x27;re not exclusively linked but it would be ignorant to deny a relationship.<p>&gt; <i>Palm pilots are pretty rare. And a lot of people liked and used palm pilots. But even brand new ones in their box are worth less than $1,000 at auction right now.</i><p>Again, retro computing hardware generally sells for less than retro gaming hardware. Also while boxed copies of specific brands Palm Pilots might be rare, there is a lot of PDAs still around and not a lot of people (compared to the retro gaming scene) collecting them. So prices are naturally going to be lower (market forces et al)<p>&gt; <i>You can only play Super Famicom games on this Nintendo Playstation. No games were ever created specifically for it.</i><p>I think you&#x27;re missing the point of why some people collect.  Sure, some of us like to buy stuff exclusively to play but there are a lot of people who like to buy simply to own.<p>You get people who collect full sets of PAL or NTSC games for a given console even knowing that they would never play most of those games. You get people who like to buy factory sealed games or hardware with no intention of opening. You get people who like to own variations of consoles (eg Pokemon, Animal Crossing, themed Nintendo Switches) even though they&#x27;re all functionally the same and you can&#x27;t actually play on more than one at a time. It&#x27;s like stamp collecting for some people; it&#x27;s not about the practical value but rather just the buzz of owning something uncommon or a collection. The more difficult or the higher the resale price could be, the greater the prestige.<p>Not everyone gets this mentality and to anyone on the outside it seems totally nuts and a complete waste of money. However regardless of your opinions, these people do exist and it&#x27;s a big part of the retro gaming scene.<p>&gt; <i>This is purely a museum piece, not a collectible item that will gain in value over time.</i><p>Of course it will gain value over time. Inflation alone will see to that. However, like collecting anything from popular culture as a retirement nest egg: there is always the risk that the market could bottom out as people who grew up with those systems die off. That&#x27;s what happened to the original gauge Hornby rail collectables (back when they had a dedicated 3rd rail for electricity). Trains used to be worth a few hundred each until recently when all the adults who collected that stuff started dying off. Now they&#x27;re practically worthless.<p>The same might happen with retro gaming as well. Though as long as Nintendo and Sony are actively making consoles, I predict there will be interest in the Nintendo Play Station. So I can&#x27;t see this particular piece losing value.<p>&gt; <i>Value is a function of supply and demand.</i><p>I&#x27;d already said that when I said things are only worth as much as someone is willing to pay. What you&#x27;re ignoring is the real demand for people collecting retro gaming hardware.<p>&gt; <i>There are thousands of chinese porcelain pieces out there worth hundreds of thousands of dollars each. Some are worth millions. Because China is a wealthy nation now filled with hundreds of millions of people trying to recoup party of their culture that they sold to the lowest bidder of yesteryear.</i><p>&gt; <i>100 years ago, a lot of these same vases that are now going for millions of dollars were literally being drilled through their bottoms and made into lamps for middle class American households.</i><p>That&#x27;s true for a lot of collectables though. There&#x27;s a period when old stuff gets sold off cheap because they&#x27;re superseded by newer stock but not old enough to be &quot;retro&quot;. Playstation 2 and 3 stuff is pretty cheap at the moment but in 10 years time those prices will start to climb. 5 years ago I could pick up Sega CIB Mega Drive &#x2F; Genesis games (CIB meaning &quot;complete in box&quot; -- so with manual, game and box) for £5 to £15 (£15 being the expensive end). Now They&#x27;re frequently a minimum of £15. Prices have literally doubled in 5 years. Same is try for the Dreamcast and Saturn too and in their cases prices climbing fast because those consoles had a limited life so there&#x27;s some rarity attached.<p>Source: my dad (rest in peace) collected model railway.

Sure enough other companies get unjustified bad press every now and then, but you have to be blind to deny the fact that each and every website, even if it's only remotely related to technology, appears to be populated with people who can't resist the urge to slam Apple for whatever is the popular Apple-fail-du-jour.<p>It's not unlike the 90', when Microsoft was in the position that Apple is now. No matter what they did, it was bad, evil, anti-competitive, it sucked, they stole the idea, whatever. I'm was guilty of irrational Microsoft hate myself back then. Today, people almost feel pity for poor Microsoft, finally trying to innovate in the smartphone and tablet space, but failing spectacularly to attract people to their platform.<p>There's really nothing surprising here. In dutch, we have this saying that goes along the lines of 'higher trees catch most of the wind'. I think it has something to do with human nature. People envy success, especially when they don't understand it. Combined with a tendency to herd around the popular opinion, it's not hard to see how successful companies attract most of the bad press. In the last few years I've seen some of the most nonsensical arguments against Apple products you couldn't even make up yourself, almost go viral on the internet.<p>At some point in time some other company will take Apple's place as the big evil technology corporation that can't do anything right.

Predictions need to be testable and falsifiable.<p>&gt; b) in modern societies being a &quot;warrior&quot; conveys power and a social position;<p>So white men conveys African-Americans power and social position when they disproportionately drafted them? That is an interpretation that the african-american will disagree with you on. Power and social position is not granted when by force someone is put into the fire line.<p>&gt; War at large is won by logistics<p>Its ridiculous argument that it servers men to be forced to stand in a fire line rather than be protected at home.<p>&gt; You claim that gender roles didn&#x27;t change during Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign.<p>Your ability to misreading caused trouble for you. Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign is infamous for rigid gender roles and trying to paint that period as a time of progressive change in gender roles flies against common knowledge.<p>&gt; Again, our Congress is largely male. How are these &quot;men rights warriors&quot; trying to &quot;regain&quot; terrain, when they are still winning by a solid 30 to 40%?<p>They don&#x27;t. &quot;Mens rights warriors&quot; fighting against &quot;social justice warriors&quot; is a boring side show and thankfully the wast majority of the population seem to not care. When they do care its because media loves to focus on it with the sad effect of increasing polarization.<p>The feminist position is currently define as post-modern feminism, which came from modern feminism that came from diversity feminism that in turn came from equality feminism that ended around the early 70s. Equality feminism held the idea that men and women are more similar than not and thus gender roles are an hindrance for equality. Diversity feminism holds the opposing view, and want to focus on the diversity but still keep equal outcomes. Diversity feminism won over the movement, and modern feminism is derived from that point of view. Post-modern is still being debated.<p>&gt; what do you think is the motivation for the &quot;men rights&quot; movement to attack those positions?<p>The part of the movement that want equality is mostly copying the views that the equality feminism held 50 years ago. Gender roles are bad, there is more in common than differences, and anything that differentiate on the basis of gender is inherently immoral.<p>Example: Should all children have a human right against religious genital mutilation? Currently only one nation has such law and that is island. Here in Sweden when the political leaders was asked if they wanted a similar law, only one out of 8 established parties said yes and that was the representative for a center-right party. By happenstance she is also the only female political leader that explicitly do not define herself as feminist. I find it strange that in order to support such law the only choice for voters is the conservative right block.<p>A gender neutral human rights law for children against genital mutilation is directly opposed by political leaders in Sweden that identify as feminist, including the minor feminist party. Instead its a mens right argument and center-right on the political plane. The mens right argument is that the gender of the victim is irrelevant when someone is putting a knife to a child and starts cutting. It should illegal regardless if its a boy or girl. The feminist movement disagree.<p>&gt; feminist positions (right to adoption? The elimination of alimony? When were those feminist issues?)<p>Guess which political movement and which decade that Sweden eliminated alimony among other law texts that had the word &quot;woman&quot; or &quot;man&quot; in it. If the guess is the &quot;feminist movement&quot; and &quot;around the 60s&quot; then you would be right. Currently only a handful of laws still exist which treat women and men differently, one which sadly have a profound effect on how victims of crimes get treated.<p>&gt; You are saying that removing the stereotype somehow will broaden the breach<p>I am not sure if you intentional are misinterpreting here. Eliminating gender roles would turn the tide and finally reduce gender segregation and make society more equal. The trend for the last 50 years is an increase gender segregation in the work force, where currently only 10% of the population work in a profession which has better than 60:40 in gender segregation.",,belorn,,1527151734,2018-05-24T08:48:54Z,comment,17142232,17130108,,,

Suppression of the message will only amplify it.<p>Prediction:<p>Trump will run again in 2024, no doubt.  Consider the implications of that for a second.  He already said he will be holding a major 2024 rally in DC during the Biden inauguration.  Imagine the shadow that will cast on Biden Day 1, especially if half the population thinks the election was stolen and no outlet for that opinion (even Fox News).  Coupled that with the current infighting within the DNC between progressives vs the corporate establishment elitist liberals that they accuse Biden of being, and they are essentially giving Trump all the foundation he needs to become the underground anti-establishment anti-DC-swamp anti-deep-state no-lobbyist no-China-influence anti-MSM anti-big-tech real-middle-east-peace i-already-was-president anti-hunter-biden-corruption and even anti-fox-news candidate which will go viral and make him even more of outlier then he was in 2016.  Trump will use all of this and more (Hunter Biden story suppression especially) as real a boogyman to point to.  The totalitarian dictator analogies will no longer hold any water when it turns out he steps down peacefully but not quietly on Nov 3rd, albeit with a huge legal fuss that fizzled out.  He will aggrandize himself and play that as him being a fighter to the bitter end to his base. I don&#x27;t think the GOP can primary anyone good enough to beat that version of Trump and you will see a massive blue collar class vote swap from DNC to GOP.<p>The writing is on the wall, eventually there will be bifurcation in Big Tech and Twitter and Youtube will become the walled garden for the left of center only and largely irreverent with conservatives with things like Parlor and BitChute and others taking the exodus.  It will turn into a battle for the centrists eyeballs to come to their sides platform or straddle both.  The analogy of Reddit banning toxic subs only holds if everyone is ACTUALLY on reddit, most simply left.  There is already talk among conservatives of alternative Reddits and Facebooks, alternatives Netflix&#x2F;Hollywood companies, alternative Fox News even.  Many will say &quot;but those will be subject to the same problems of early Twitter and Reddit, how to excise the toxic elements and keep the real discussion.&quot;  I would say that can EASILY be done without going down the censorship rabbit hole by simply knowing where to stop.  Get rid of the illegal stuff, the spam and pornography, and leave the rest regardless of how distasteful it is.  Its an Overton Window problem, you just need slightly looser boundary condition on discourse.  Stop pretending to be platforms and admit you are indeed publishers to an extent.  Give users the ability to filter what they don&#x27;t want to see and pledge to never bias your algorithms.  The cries of the left will be largely irrelevant, they will simply tell you to &quot;go back to Twitter if you don&#x27;t like it&quot;.  Once the public loses faith and trust in your company or institution due to your sacrifices in credibility in the name of censorship of one sides information, there wont be any coming back from that loss of face.  I&#x27;m not saying this is a good or healthy thing for public discourse, but I do think ti will come to pass.<p>Its questionable whether Biden will make it all the way through his term due to age and decline, and he has already said he will step down after one term.  That means the DNC will likely roll with Kamala next (If they are smart they would re-primary her, but I dont think they have the will to, the backlash and collectivist guilt will be huge).  Kamala who couldn&#x27;t get 2% of her parties own primary vote in 2020, up against juggernaut viral version of Trump holding mega rallies and creating an alternative media empire he has already dropped hints at.<p>I predict the headlines of the future will largely revolve around how the MSM and Big Tech blew it and need find a way to outreach and repair their reputations and faith to the general public - and will look back at this move as a huge mistake compounding others.  The landscape will look totally different.<p>I welcome anyones disagreement with my prediction.

The political fallout of these actions I suspect will be a true rise in authoritarianism because violence will lead to chaos which leads to more violence, which leads to authoritarianism to suppress violence.

The big difference now is that the tools at the hands of the government have never been more powerful.<p>This is not a moment where everyone is sacrificing, the managerial class of America &amp; the executive class can maintain their pay, while 30% of Americans probably go unemployed, and every single small business in America has lost everything.

If we extend the statistics further to include Silicon Valley salaries of $200k+, that places them in the top 5%.<p>I can&#x27;t think of any unionization in labor history that <i>originated</i> with members in the top 5% of salaries.

(Early MLB players had to have 2nd jobs and share hotel rooms on the road.)  As a thought experiment... one might argue that if the NFL were to restart today after the invention of TV, there <i>would not be a players union</i>.  Instead the roster of 53 football players would be 53 independent contractors.  Indeed, modern players in &quot;sports&quot; teams like eSports are mostly independent contractors.  The technology of tv magnifies individuality (Tom Brady&#x27;s face also sells cars &amp; watches for endorsement deals).  Today&#x27;s marketability of the individual instead of the team would make it harder to convince 50%+ of players to elect union representation.  (NASCAR drivers and UFC MMA fighters had&#x2F;have grumblings about union representation that have gone nowhere so far.  Also, they first have to switch to from independent contractors to employees -- which is another set of hurdles.)<p>Some airline pilots (with seniority) are 5% salary but in the 1930s they weren&#x27;t when the union formed.<p>So, when would 50%+[2] programmers willing want to pay union dues -- say 1.5% (SAG) or 1.4% (UAW) of their salary?!?  When the economic conditions of programmers match the poor conditions of the previous successful unionization efforts.  We&#x27;re obviously nowhere near that situation with software devs (even ones without college degrees) earning good salaries.<p>Some other commenters recommend that <i>now</i> is the best time to unionize <i>because</i> the current times are good for programmers.  My question to that is... has that ever happened in history?<p>Basically, the main driver for unionization is economic conditions instead of ideological stance.  If one believes more in the the ideology rather than economics,  then yes it seems realistic to think that top-5% salary earners will vote themselves into a union.  Since I emphasize economic conditions, I predict they won&#x27;t -- at least not within the next 10 years.

,,"I have nothing against vesting the wealth into gold. I&#x27;m not keen on relying upon secondary markets for wealth storage; bond markets for that purpose are more aligned to what I advocate. I&#x27;m on the fence with tying energy storage to wealth storage, still reading up on a thermodynamic basis of economic structures.<p>I see lots of negative externalities to using preferential credit instruments in a debt-backed monetary system securing land as a store of wealth, especially for late-stage generations like the Millenials and later are experiencing first-hand. The process takes many generations to play out the stage we&#x27;re at, so it builds up vested interests until some final set of bag holders gets the sucker punch. They (Millenials and later) are on the wrong side of an asset inflation to wage inflation ratio curve function that looks ugly and not resolvable without tremendous disruption to world asset markets.<p>In an agrarian or even industrial development era, it makes sense that land is a large direct contributor to output profits, and to ascribe wealth storage to it as the improvements that sit on top are enhanced. To my unsophisticated and untrained layman&#x27;s sense, this reasoning starts to fall apart as industrialization is increasingly mechanized and automated, but there is still a tiny shred of reasoning. I can&#x27;t find even a slim reasoning for continuing the practice when the land itself doesn&#x27;t contribute directly to the economic output, which I sense is the case when cognitive effort is the majority input to economic output. Land value then in a commercial real estate context starts to reflect a proximity to supply chain networks where the supply chain is for physically-located talent (SV). That makes sense, though I&#x27;m interested to see the impact if VR&#x2F;AR matures and virtual offices with startlingly-realistic telepresence become feasible (I predict the first 3-6 generations of that tech won&#x27;t have an impact, and only the later generations will).<p>Where the reasoning really decouples for me however, is residential real estate. There, I would have expected pricing to essentially follow median wages. Effectively modeling median housing prices as a put option: term length the duration of the median mortgage, strike price the wage earner&#x27;s expected career earnings over that duration lining up with the house price (or some appropriate fraction thereof). That didn&#x27;t happen, so I&#x27;m misinterpreting something, or don&#x27;t understand something about using real estate as a store of value, or the market is just staying irrational longer than I am expecting.<p>I dunno, just rambling here, please correct what is certainly my poor interpretation of what&#x27;s going on here. I&#x27;m just a layman trying to figure out why residential real estate prices seem decoupled from median local income in so many geographies at the same time. I started wandering down these ponderings when I realized that as a remote worker in the US, only some pretty far out places had escaped the residential real estate inflation, whereas in the 70&#x27;s driving only an hour out of town led to a drastic 75%+ drop in per acre prices. I ended up staying pretty close to an urban area, and paying off my property as quickly as possible, but I feel terrible for the younger generations getting completely screwed.",,yourapostasy,,1478741353,2016-11-10T01:29:13Z,comment,12916848,12915778,,,

,,"Hello there,<p>Kindly I address you and sincerely this is not intended as spam or self promoting but a sincere invitation to all and my passion like all free minded individuals like a lot of you no doubt learned &amp; clearly enlightened individuals to share with those that believe in the same ideals and in the process help you make a mega fortune up to 1000% returns or more in 5 years with options to withdraw earnings monthly or yearly which you can do anonymously too I want to introduce you to Bitcoin Private Bank &amp; Blaze Power Corporation. Lets put this in perspective. If you deposit 1BTC today with Bitcoin Private Bank you are guaranteed to earn 16.67% interest every month this is guaranteed regardless of market conditions this is the banks base  interest rate you will always get this no matter what which is better than keeping Bitcoin in a non interest bearing Bitcoin wallet this revenue can also help you mitigate the ever increasing Bitcoin transfer fees &amp; constant rate fluctuations it is also safer than cold storage because the bank stands guarantor for your funds (better than FDIC). Cold storage is not entirely safe because you can lose or corrupt the hardware, key store even a paper wallet can be lost or stolen cold storage is not a fool proof solution (read on it gets better). But for the more ambitious individual there is even greater reward when you invest rather than just banking &amp; I will elaborate. Looking at Blaze Power market share 100% (there is no direct competitor i.e based on rate of production &amp; service revenue from wholesale discounted power supply). The actual growth rate of Blaze Power Corporation is thus in excess of this, 1BTC investment in Blaze Power Corporation today would net you $3,000,000.00 in 5 years, that is $50,000.00 earned every month for a 1BTC investment this is not theory or speculation, ponzi or a pyramid but based on actual performance &amp; energy market fundamentals. Obviously like any other IPO (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft including early days of Bitcoin etc) the trick is to buy as many shares as you can then watch the value of your shares grow as the company expands rapidly &amp; watch yourself go from Bitcoin to Millionaire in a short space of time. Impossible? Well unlike Facebook, Google, Twitter or Microsoft we actually have a world changing tangible product worth trillions &amp; a life critical &amp; essential service (Unlimited Electricity which ironically is also the backbone of all Bitcoin mining, the major overhead &amp; determines the difference between break even or bankruptcy in Bitcoin mining thus how can you go wrong?). What or who is Blaze Power Corporation? Well I will elaborate. I am CEO of Blaze Power Corporation. My company is here <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blaze-power.eu"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blaze-power.eu</a> and just like Germany we have a big drive toward the eradication of the Nuclear danger &amp; threat. We have created a revolutionary new way to create power without nuclear waste or hot fission radioactive reaction. We have invented reactive power reactor or Fueless Energy Acquisition Reactor &quot;FEAR Tech™&quot; as we acronym it (see the website) worth untold billions even trillions of EUR&#x2F;GBP&#x2F;USD whichever you prefer. You can invest in this marvelous technology with Bitcoin (or regular Bank Transfers if anonymity is of no concern to you) through a Bitcoin offshore investment bank <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitcoin-bank.trade"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitcoin-bank.trade</a> to also help raise awareness in the future of Green Energy, privacy which are all under threat. DO NOT take my word for it just read the Testimonials &amp; see what existing clients have to say. To put this into perspective (see Bitcoin Bank) for every 1BTC you invest today you are guaranteed to have more than $30million USD in share value alone within 5 years if of course you do not sell your shares this is factoring in the rate of growth of Blaze Power Technology thus for every 1BTC or more you invest now you are a guaranteed millionaire in 5 years. Checkout both websites and have an open mind do not miss out like those caught sleeping in the early days of Microsoft when people laughed at Bill Gates when he stated that software would outsell hardware when it comes to computing, this then is one of those moments thus this is the time to get in your chance, it&#x27;s not too late. Spread the word and let us make a difference business wise &amp; conscious. Visit YouTube and keyword FUKUSHIMA danger 2016 you are also saving the world &amp; making a big difference. You are not safe as long as Nuclear reactors still exist this is your chance to make a mega profit &amp; save the world at the same time. Before you get skeptical take a look at what famous individuals in history said (as pointed out by a savvy investor at Bitcoin Bank) and quote:<p>“The horse is here to stay, but automobiles are only a novelty, a fad.” Horace Rackham, 1903<p>“Rock &amp; Roll will be gone by June” Variety Magazine 1955<p>“Remote shopping while entirely feasible will flop” Time Magazine 1968<p>“Television will not last. It is a flash in the pan.” Mary Summerville 1948<p>“Next Christmas, the I-Pod will be dead, finished, gone, kaput.” Alan Sugar 2005<p>“There is no likelihood man can tap the power of the atom.” Robert Millikan, 1923<p>“The telephone has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication.” William Horton 1876<p>“I predict the internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.” Robert Metcalf 1995<p>“The cinema is little more than a fad.” Charlie Chaplin 1916<p>“The idea that calvarly will be replaced with these iron coaches is absurd.” Field Marchsall Haig, 1916 talking about the tank<p>“Fooling around with alternating current is just a waste of time. No one will ever use it.” Thomas Edison 1889<p>“I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.” — Thomas
Watson, chairman of IBM, 1943.<p>“There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home.” — Ken Olson, president, chairman and founder of Digital Equipment Corp., 1977.<p>PS*: An idea?

Some examples include:<p>- Paper certificates of ownership of ideas&#x2F;ingantible works, which have been used for art in the past going back some decades, and maybe somewhat more common now with certain conceptual &#x2F; digital art pieces.<p>- A centralized leger, as the folks from Blain|Southern tried to do with seditionart.com.<p>- Or, maybe you can do something with federation, as you suggest?<p>That is just a tech argument of whether a blockchain (say Proof of Stake-based to avoid the energy argument) or something else is better, but note: It changes nothing about what the <i>NFT</i> is (and we can still call it that for simplicity). It would seem to do nothing to alleviate the concerns of people who don&#x27;t understand paying for a pointer to a media file; since that is still what the federated ledger tracks, right?<p>If people feel a federated system works better for this, they can certainly build it. But Twitter is just Instagram from a purely technical perspective.

I.e. your analysis about the trust vectors involved making the chain useless is wrong. Sure, platforms can choose not to show certain NFTs, and OpenSea has some dominance in the space, but when OpenSea kicked off a Cryptopunk Clone project no one lost their tokens, they continued to be traded elsewhere, and the community still chose to value their possessions, even if it maybe inhibited their growth.<p>There is really nothing centralized at the center of it in the end.

The human brain uses something like 10-20 watts, how much CV&#x2F;ML can you do with 10-20 watts?  Not much at all.   There is clearly a huge disconnect between our current approach to solving the problem technologically and how the evolutionary wetware solves the problem.

Ask HN: Why not use SVG for everything?,,"Some context: It seems like web development is stuck in a frustrating limbo between utilizing HTML presentationally, while trying to maintain a balance with ARIA&#x2F;accessibility and so-called semantic markup.

,,"Or the explanation could be that Lisp just isn't that great.  First of all, it doesn't even make much sense to talk about ""Lisp"" as if it's a language.  The difference between the toy lisp you can write an interpreter for in a page of code and Clojure is night and day.  And the other features are actually much more important than just being a Lisp.  I'd be afraid to work with the ""Haskell"" that the smug Lisper of the article slaps out with macros.  Not only would it probably not be as well designed as Haskell, unless they copied Haskell's hard work wholesale, but it wouldn't interop well with any other Lisp code.<p>Secondly, if you actually look at the defining feature of Lisp, S-Exprs and macros, it's not a good idea.  Code generating S-exprssions may be more sane than generating C code through string manipulation, but it's still a bad idea and for the same reasons.  Code is a human readable format (even if you force it to be S-expressions and pretend it isn't).  Code shouldn't be generating other code, it should be generating more structured values.  There are composability advantages to doing so and as an added benefit, you don't get stuck with S-expressions as syntax.  I predict that in the not too distant future, languages will provide a better alternative to almost every current use of macros (we're already over half way there).",,shasta,,1302907022,2011-04-15T22:37:02Z,comment,2452490,2450973,,,

Migrating a successful service is often much harder than the initial cloud build.<p>The Heroku -&gt; AWS path is a pretty natural one to take. You could stay in Heroku, create an AWS account and start managing your DNS configuration with an IAC tool (e.g. terraform) in AWS. That then opens up a bunch of options later down the line, like S3 integrations, peering an AWS VPC with Heroku, wiring up various AWS managed services, CDN, cert issuance and so on, all using the same basic tech. You could keep your current workflow but a pretty smooth migration path available to move off Heroku and into AWS on your own time. If you need to. I don&#x27;t &quot;love&quot; AWS, but I know most of the rough edges now and I think that&#x27;s how a lot of people feel about it.<p>I think Heroku also has pretty strong GCP integration so that&#x27;s also a natural option.<p>You could also avoid making a cloud choice now and just use any DNS provider with a decent API.<p>P.S: I think you could be successful with any of the services you listed, but would not recommend Linode, Hetzner, OVH etc due to the lack of managed service options.

Already they were trailing behind the after party with their releases post AMD Ryzen, and I havn&#x27;t heard anything at all exciting on NVIDIAs part to counter since the Vulkan release and SPIR-V integration announcements, which are some of the most promising I&#x27;ve seen yet, and expansive for programmers who have otherwise avoided this platform due to the extremely indepth learning curve and requirements to be somewhat experienced C&#x2F;C++ programmers.<p>It took me 8months to be able to write a good kernel and some good host code with opencl because I did the entire integration in C and C++ and I&#x27;ve been developing with it since 1.2, but with more languages a broader range of support applications, perspectives and contributions will go to the opensource dev.<p>So far, outside of currently dominating the industry and embedding some long term runway with large contracts and having a head on red tape involved with larger corporations they have contracts for hardware and support embedded with, I don&#x27;t see what advantages NVIDIA is getting the industry excited about in the long run.<p>When it comes to savvy programmers in Silicon Valley, a friend of mine who works as a PhD programmer in Deep Learning with Google Scientists did an unofficial ad hoc poll on her twitter, asking people why so much opencl hate and so much CUDA in the valley? There were lots of responses from lots of people, but I only saw on repeated reason over and over again, the initial learning curve is lower with CUDA and its more convenient. There were no specs of performance advantages in discussion.<p>In the functionalities I apply OpenCL to, CUDA doesn&#x27;t even offer the same functionality, and in many ways processes algorithms by simply parsing out algorithms CPUs utilized, but OpenCL never assumed this as an optimal path, and reconsiders the entire structure of the algorithm and data its working with, often times reorganizing formats for processing entirely different from CPUs that NVIDIA incorporates as a default.<p>It&#x27;s more work to learn than CUDA, but the advantages are worth it in my experience so far.<p>As a last consideration, When it comes to NVIDIA trying to make their products compatible with OpenCL and OpenGL, I predict that promise of that to be delayed at best, as it took NVIDIA 5 years to make their hardware std OpenCl 1.2 compatible.  Vulkan is extremely large in terms of the source code, and SPIR-V is nontrivial, OpenCL is standard 2.0 now, so if getting OpenCL 1.2 was hard for them to integrate in under 5 years, we can expect a lot longer given the new releases.<p>The learning curve is now going away with the recent releases, so whats the next step with NVIDIA? Good question.

They are academically, socially and creatively inclined, but they don&#x27;t want to build &#x27;products and services&#x27; and aren&#x27;t keen on making &#x27;big bucks&#x27;.<p>The series of &#x27;big business&#x27; magnates that came up in Quebec over the last 40 years have been mostly locally oriented: taking up TV&#x2F;Media, Energy and retail banking sectors during the &#x27;quiet revolution&#x27;. The big &#x27;startup&#x27; here is a Circus!<p>In my very Francophone neighbourhood, 100% of the waiters and waitresses will tell you they are &#x27;in school&#x27; or &#x27;actors&#x27; or &#x27;photographers&#x27; - yet many of them are late 20&#x27;s early 30&#x27;s - and it&#x27;s not exactly hollywood around here. An acquaintance calls herself a &#x27;playwright&#x27; and she&#x27;s written 2 tiny productions for the local theatre with 2 actors each - no props or anything. She&#x27;s late in her &#x27;career&#x27; already. This attitude is due to a bunch of historical factors and it runs deep.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting people can&#x27;t build great companies here, and surely some will pop up - and there are some natural advantages such as lots of students and ridiculously low cost of living ... but I&#x27;m not sure if anything big will come of it.<p>To grow a startup you need all sorts of motivated people with special skills: recruiting, supply chain, sometimes niche stuff like ASICS etc. - I never, ever meet anyone here remotely in that vein.<p>It&#x27;s a great city, but I&#x27;m not sure it will ever be the &#x27;leader&#x27; in anything applied or industrious.

,,"What&#x27;s the goal with all this testing?<p>The simple reality is that unless you have a large proportion of your population immune (either due to infection or vaccine) you will NOT be able to reverse the lockdown successfully without seeing a surge in infections and deaths shortly after. So you can test as much as you want, but this whole pandemic started from ONE person in China so as long as there is 1 or 5 or more likely 100s or 1000s of cases in any country then as soon as restrictions are loosened the infection rate will exponentially go up again.<p>You can play the game of opening&#x2F;closing schools&#x2F;shops every couple weeks for about 2 years until everyone either got eventually infected or we might see a vaccine hitting the public. Even if a vaccine might be available at the end of 2020, it won&#x27;t be available to the public across the globe for yet another year if not longer. That is just simple maths on manufacturing and distribution, anyone who thinks differently is completely dillusional.<p>So my question remains, what is the end goal with all of the testing? Calling testing as a way out of the lockdown is either a dumb assertion, because more testing won&#x27;t stop the spread (contact tracing and isolation will only slow the exponential outbreak by days or couple weeks), or it is a lie to give the public false hope.<p>There is only two ways out:<p>- Now, by lifting all lockdown restrictions, target, shield and isolate the most vulnerable in our society (old &amp; fragile, people with diabetes, cancer, HIV, etc.), ramp up hospital capacity and let the virus rage through the remaining population, hoping that everyone else will mostly experience mild or no symptoms and only very few people who need hospitalisation and who will die given that the most vulnerable remain in isolation...<p>or<p>- stay in lockdown for 24 months at a minimum until there&#x27;s the capacity to manufacture and supply a vaccine to roughly 60% of the population with a pointless ping pong exercise of easing and tightening the restrictions<p>I&#x27;m honestly not sure which one is better, but there is literally NO OTHER OPTION.<p>Most of Europe is currently going down the second option and Sweden is mostly leading on the first option. I predict that if in ~ 6 months time countries will see that there&#x27;s little difference in the death rate between countries with tright restrictinos and those with lax restrictions (because tight restrictions only delay the deaths, but don&#x27;t prevent) then everyone will change to a more Swedish model probably.<p>Only time will tell the truth.",,dustinmoris,,1587330993,2020-04-19T21:16:33Z,comment,22918863,22916392,,,

It is tied to the proliferation of new computing devices, as consumer behaviour shifts towards using many &#x27;computers&#x27;, rather than one.<p>My prediction is that the number of computing devices will continue to increase, offloading our computing to more and more devices. I predict that the mean lifetime of these devices will also increase. A high-end desktop from 2020 will last until 2030, capable of running the same OS and programs for the average person.

,,"I can&#x27;t speak for each brand or agency, but the majority have been vocal with YouTube or FB or Twitter for years. Each of those ad platforms has a slew of teams that work directly with the enterprise buyers (top advertisers). I remember a major USA bank giving explicit feedback to the YouTube product team six years ago due to limited brand safe content control. I was in the room. There are still two accepted strategies for delivering ads on user generated content networks. One, that if user targeting is used  and an ad is served against questionable content, then the content is less important. Why? You delivered an ad to your target market. Two, even with user targeting, the ad&#x27;s context and content should align with the advertisers ad. I think we are seeing #2 uptick across the board.<p>For networks like YouTube and Facebook they are in control of the algorithm, feed, ad decisioning, user targeting, and cost. Why can&#x27;t they afford transparency and more control for advertisers? I don&#x27;t know to be honest. I assume those features would limit revenue.<p>To answer your last question, I also don&#x27;t know what tipped it. It seems like society is shifting quickly right now and brands want to better align with those changes. Someone else asked if all of this was for the sake of practicality. That is a part of it. Users are influenced by advertising and while we can&#x27;t decipher the exact mix of it that truly influences behavior, brands are trying to protect themselves from egregious content.<p>I try to create physical analogies for my clients. Let&#x27;s pretend the path to our storefront (selling clothes) is in a manufacturing warehouse park. Who is going to be enticed to enter the path to the store, or be curious to learn about the store&#x27;s wares? I predict few folks would enter. It is similar to ads across the web. Some are there to entice you to click (enter) their store and some are there to inform you. Either way, context likely has some influence. Brands acknowledge that. Not to mention, zero brands want someone to screenshot their video or display ad next to something deemed malicious.<p>Lastly, it is hard for advertisers to turn their backs on channels that generate high returns or are table stakes. What would you do if the billboard that drove the most customers to your store was in a seedy location 20% of the time? The billboard owner sold it as is. So you either take it or leave it. Most business owners would buy it and deal with the risk. That is what we&#x27;ve seen play out on YouTube and Facebook.<p>Edit: I will add that sophisticated advertisers are shifting their performance metrics from pure lead-generation sales or site visits to incrementality measurement. They want to measure if ad exposure changes consumer behavior. Perhaps we will see that FB and YT have high influence or not or something in the middle. The changes in measurement will have major impacts on advertising spend.",,fumar,,1593152832,2020-06-26T06:27:12Z,comment,23649276,23649138,,,

,,"You make decent points but are missing the bigger picture: vast majority of problems with security, esp code injection, are caused by mechanisms or design patterns that create insecurity by default. It takes insane amounts of effort to use the basic, building blocks on complex applications without creating problems. The building blocks themselves are often simple or can be made that way. That you say the robust methods only work on the simplest stuff is actually an endorsement of my approach if we focus them on building blocks. That&#x27;s what I mainly push it for so let&#x27;s test my theory with a real-world example.<p>We&#x27;ll only use techniques from production systems made before the 80&#x27;s, that were commercially successful, and that exist today in some form. Should make it easy to argue practicality. Gives us Burroughs B5500 (1963) and IBM System&#x2F;38 (1979). Pointers are tagged for protection, actual value inaccessible by apps, and created by program loader only. Memory is tagged as code or data during load time with all input from I&#x2F;O tagged as data by default by hardware. Any input can&#x27;t be executed unless administrator explicitly allows it and it&#x27;s actually the compiler that does that anyway since apps come as source in type-safe, HLL in Burroughs model. Interfaces are checked during compilation, too. Processor checks these on every instruction. Also does bounds checking, overflow checking, type-checking of function call arguments, and stack protection. Checks and processor run in parallel for performance with final state not written unless check passes. So, you can&#x27;t smash pointers, arrays, buffers, stacks, or individual data with overflow: all just generates exceptions which are recovered from or freeze app with admin notification.<p>So, you want to hijack the app via a corrupted PDF or network packet. Assume, as you said, that the simple mechanisms above were implemented at EAL6-7 and apps just used them. Where would you start with a <i>software attack</i> (no rowhammer lol) with input to an app if you only got exceptions when hitting pointers, data fields, memory management, stacks, and arrays&#x2F;buffers? What&#x27;s left? If you&#x27;re claim is true, then these simple modifications provide no meaningful increase to the reliability or security of our systems. There&#x27;s other security risks but I&#x27;m focusing on code injection via attacking software with input. I predict attacker&#x27;s job is so difficult in this model that most would go for social engineering or sabotaging executables to attack compiler&#x2F;installer&#x2F;loader. Those are also protected by these mechanisms and ruggedly built (eg Ada or SPARK w&#x2F; all checks on). You&#x27;re actually more knowledgeable and skilled than me at the many implementation attack methods. How many are left at this point? Seriously, so I can counter them too.<p>Funny you mentioned hardware. It certainly does have errata here and there. Yet, that&#x27;s despite tens of millions to billions of transistors running concurrently. Its error rate is actually incredible. I wonder why. Let&#x27;s look at design flow for Intel, IBM, etc.: specs to RTL to gates with equivalence checking at each layer; lots of testing; formal verification (Intel) and falsification (IBM) of stuff at various layers; synthesis tools with validation approaches to that; generic components with interfaces and timing analysis; gate-level testing to see where tools were lying; comparisons of instrumented chip to the models after a fab run. The difficulties were overcome by constantly investing in tools for various problems and heuristics that made them work better. Guess what? Those methods look very similar to the B3, A1, EAL6, and other assurance activities. They also <i>worked</i>: quality in terms of errata varied from staying steady to improving over time despite exponential increases in complexity.<p>Believe it or not, you don&#x27;t need to verify a whole system at highest levels. I&#x27;m not even promising absolute security from the effort: just saying systems designed this way have had incredible resilience to pentests, faults, and external attacks. I say invest the effort into mechanisms like above, languages immune to what we can, analysis tools catching what we can, compilers, most-used parts of kernels, interfaces (esp glue), parsers, and so on. These have already been built rather than theory: really just re-applying existing work to new system. Less than 1% of code and design done right knocks out 99% of routes for code-injection and many other issues in the rest of the system. The rest we catch with security research and reviews. Or recover from after monitoring detects problems.<p>So, Thomas, would you trust an x86-style processor with a monolithic kernel coded in C? Or a system like EROS running on my above CPU that only uses safe mechanisms (hardware-enforced), safe languages, and robust tools for making one properly use the other? Even if COTS-style implementation, the amount of vulnerabilities and their severity should nose dive. Your current position is that 400 kernel and thousands of user-level vulnerabilities resulting in malware execution are better than thousands of user-mode exceptions, a few kernel-exceptions, and maybe a few injects from what we didn&#x27;t see coming. I disagree and think we can do better. Friggin 1960&#x27;s-1970&#x27;s tech had better security &amp; reliability than current architectures! Academics (see crash-safe.org or CHERI) have with way less time and money than Intel, IBM, etc. So, why do you speculate? Methods that got results against problems before will get results against same kinds of problems again. Just need to <i>apply them</i> and in most cost-effective way.

,,"This is probably <i>the</i> most hot topic for database <i>service</i> providers. Operating hundreds of thousands and millions of databases yields a valuable collateral: operational data (what users are doing, metadata, table shapes, query patterns, application behavior, reasons for blocking, IO patterns, memory patterns, everything). Take the tuning wizards of 5 years ago, add machine learning on vast amounts of operational data, add &#x27;shadow&#x27; A&#x2F;B testing (run a secondary instance shadowing the same workload, on a copy of the database, but, say, apply an index recommendation to the shadow instance and measure the impact). When I left Microsoft one year ago, this whole area was seen as a gold mine and there was massive investment into it. You can already see such offerings as Azure SQL Database Advisor[1]. I&#x27;m convinced Amazon is doing its own research in this space, specially for Aurora.<p>We&#x27;re talking much more than just index optimizations. Think automatic OLTP vs. OLAP pattern detection and migration of data into columnstores or in-memory tables. Automatic detection of cold vs. hot data and migration to-from expensive fast near storage (SSD) vs. cheap remote storage (S3 like). Automatic resizing of instance size. Materialized views. On-the-fly query rewrite. The field is wide open. And you have the best experts in the field looking at <i>your</i> database.<p>By contrast, the traditional on-premise auto-tuning did not made much progress over the past 10-15 years. There are reasons for this: small operational dataset (one site only), high risk of regression (difficult to do A&#x2F;B testing), scarcity of experts. The best avenue for on-premise I predict will be the trickle-down effect of migrating service know-how and technologies to on-premise offerings. We&#x27;re also going to see a push up the stack of the know-how and experience from operating the service making its way into the app stack (think EntityFramework v. 2018?) and helping developers avoid the common pitfalls.<p>BTW, only 3 days ago Adrian Coyler&#x27;s morning paper discussion was Self-driving database management systems [2]<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;azure&#x2F;sql-database&#x2F;sql-database-advisor"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;azure&#x2F;sql-database&#x2F;sql-data...</a>

For two reasons:<p>1) it completely breaks the functional programming model that we all learned as toddlers (instead of call A and then, after that&#x27;s done, call B, Async is call A which just installs B as a callback, returns immediately and then an &quot;event loop&quot; calls B). Note that promises and tasks and futures are just &quot;syntactic sugar&quot;. Personally I&#x27;m not a fan. I don&#x27;t use any of that. I just use callbacks.<p>2) Even though Async it&#x27;s great for concurrency, it&#x27;s not great for parallelism. Everything runs with one thread. So if you want parallel processing you need workers.<p>But I would argue that issue 1 can be overcome. In fact, I find Async to be quite elegant. I think in the long term people are going to realize that maybe we&#x27;ve had it backwards all along.<p>Issue 2 is actually not that big of a deal for most things. It&#x27;s actually somewhat unusual that you need to have some CPU intensive operation running in the background. Maybe image processing, data modelling, etc. But most blocking operations are just I&#x2F;O operations which are not using CPU that much. If I needed to write some kind of network server, I would look at using libuv as a portable runtime.",,bodeadly,,1580269878,2020-01-29T03:51:18Z,comment,22177194,22165193,,,

Convention and desire for free and equal access to basic education is one of the cornerstones of the meritocracy, which prevents a purely economic solution. Even at the university level the government gives lenders extra recourse and the schools themselves provide aid.<p>2. Credentialism: access to well known schools is highly prized and self perpetuating. Even if a new school has an excellent staff it could take decades for graduates to go out in the world and make the school's reputation.<p>3. Access to peers: beyond pure credentialism and instructor quality is the caliber of the fellow students that can make a big difference.<p>4. GPA inflation. The students constantly try to exert pressure on the instructor to raise GPA.

,,"I&#x27;ve toyed with hooks for a few hours and, even if I understand why they&#x27;re focusing on teaching the basic pitfalls (dependencies arrays mostly), I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re the most confusing part (as long as you know how closures work, i.e. as long as you know JS).<p>The real deal is `useEffect` vs `useLayoutEffect`. It seems easy, but it&#x27;s not. When should I use each? According to the docs, use `Layout` if you interact with the DOM for measurement or whatever (I mean, look at its name)... WRONG!<p>I made a custom `useFetch` hook that uses `useEffect` to re-fetch when the URL changes. It should be fine, right? Every other `useFetch` I&#x27;ve seen on GitHub does that too... And it&#x27;s wrong.<p>I noticed that as soon as I added a second `useFetch` that fetches depending on the first&#x27;s data, there is flashing in the UI. Since `useEffect` is asynchronous, there&#x27;s a small gap where both internal states can be desynchronized (completely unrelated to the promise, I mean the internal `isLoading`, etc.) `useLayoutEffect` solves the issue (since it blocks the rendering until both effects are finished updating their internal states) but then... my internal hook implementation affects the external behavior in non-obvious ways!<p>I don&#x27;t know whether my hook consumer needs to block the UI until all updates finish, so I actually need to make two different `useFetch` and `useSyncFetch` hooks, or just ditch the async one.<p>It&#x27;s definitely a footgun. I predict this is going to bite everyone&#x27;s ass. It&#x27;s also not really well understood (try searching for &quot;useEffect vs useLayoutEffect&quot;) and the React team is completely ignoring the issue. I haven&#x27;t seen it mentioned anywhere, and I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m the only one that noticed it (I guess hooks haven&#x27;t been used that much yet?)<p>The issue is exacerbated by `useEffect` being the &quot;default&quot; in the docs, while `useLayoutEffect` is explained later as an option (even if they admit that it&#x27;s the safest option if you&#x27;re migrating from classes).<p>I recommend sticking to `useLayoutEffect` unless you&#x27;re absolutely 100% sure your consumer does not need to block the UI (when can you be 100% sure?)<p>There&#x27;s a similar thing with `useState` vs `useRef` for mutable state (where the only difference is that `useState` triggers re-renders) but since `useState` is presented as the default (re-render even if you don&#x27;t know if for consumer needs to) it does not seem like that much of a footgun (you have to reach for `useRef` if you really need it, e.g. in the infamous `useInterval` Abramov&#x27;s blog post). It&#x27;s also very similar to how state vs. instance variables worked, and it&#x27;s very obvious how `useState` interacts with React (completely different behavior unlike `useLayoutEffect`, which is the same but in different parts of the component lifecycle).<p>When your internal hook implementation affects your component&#x27;s behavior in non-obvious ways, there&#x27;s something wrong with the hooks API. As proof, see how many custom `useFetch` hooks use `useLayoutEffect` when they should. Zero. And I&#x27;m sure there are many more instances of this problem hidden in other custom hooks (it&#x27;s hard to tell, since it&#x27;s not obvious until you use a hook that depends on other hook&#x27;s output and see the flashing).",,kaoD,,1552291845,2019-03-11T08:10:45Z,comment,19357407,19356806,,,

,,"This is a rehash of a previous post of mine regarding electricity consumption. Just wanted to repost this to get more eyeballs and critiques:<p>Back in the days where all our electricity came from fossil fuels, I completely agree that marginal electricity usage was bad for the environment. However I think that thought has persisted with us even though it is no longer true 100% of the time. With renewables sometimes the marginal cost of electricity to our environment is near 0 or even negative (eg, during periods of higher winds and lower demand.)<p>I predict that in the future as bitcoin mining becomes more and more of an efficiency game that you will see bitcoin mining be kind of a load balancer the grid, effectively turning off during peak demand (or low supply) times and contributing to the base load during regular times.<p>For example, it may even help the economics of building new wind plants. Eg, currently it may not be profitable to build a new wind plant because base load is too low that the excess power generated would need to be sold off at 0 or even negative prices. However if bitcoin mining could be turned on during these times and off during periods of high demand, there will need to be fewer peaker plants in operation and it would positively affect the economics of opening a new wind plant.<p>Bitcoin mining only cares about the cost of electricity at a given time, it is not like most other electricity demands that are very time based. With the large variance of electricity generation by renewables, I think bitcoin can in the future help smooth demand according to the real supply&#x2F;demand curve.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like a different implementation of the Tesla utility grid batteries. Instead of deploying power, you force the grid to build more renewable capacity (that the miners are paying for) that you use except in peak periods, where you turn off and effectively provide the grid with more power.<p>Here are 2 articles of a bitcoin mining company doing just this:

Given that the Government has the power to imprison you where private organizations don&#x27;t, and that the Government will do so for certain (e.g. pro-terrorism) speeches now, it is important to make the distinction that a Congressperson asking AT&amp;T if they intend to carry Fox News in future is different to the Government arresting a Fox News journalist, CEO, or AT&amp;T CEO, and that the difference is large.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>Yes, private organization can deplatform, censor, and silence any opinions they disagree with.</i>&quot;<p>Yes they can, I haven&#x27;t denied it. What I have said is that you can use your freedoms to start new private organizations where you can post opinions you agree with and silence opinions <i>you</i> disagree with, or walk about with a billboard in the town square. You have the right to speak, you don&#x27;t have the right to a large audience on a popular platform. That&#x27;s why private organizations deplatforming you is different even if the Government is leaning (which I don&#x27;t agree they are), and the difference matters.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>What we clearly have here is a case of a political party, in control of Congress, seeking a way to circumvent the US Constitution (specifically the 1st Amendment) by nakedly intimidating private organizations into enacting censorship on their behalf, to be perpetrated against said political party&#x27;s political enemies.</i>&quot;<p>No we don&#x27;t clearly have that. We clearly have a couple (two) members of Congress sending a form letter to a dozen media companies asking 7 fairly trivial questions. If you&#x27;re going to claim &quot;nakedly intimidating&quot; please point out the intimidating wording in the letter. Since there isn&#x27;t any, you can&#x27;t, so I predict you&#x27;re not going to respond to this bit in good faith either.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>That is flatly wrong, and should be viewed as Government attempting to censor political enemies... because that is what it is!</i>&quot;<p>I am not going to copy-paste the entire letter here, but following up on an event which happened by writing a letter asking if Roku did anything to support or stop carrying media about the event, is not flatly wrong, it&#x27;s a normal and expected kind of investigation. It seems very likely that the media companies in question will send back lawerly responses saying &quot;we do not filter content, we have a fair use policy, we were monitoring events and took (some&#x2F;no) actions&quot; and that will be all that comes of it.",,jodrellblank,,1614122768,2021-02-23T23:26:08Z,comment,26244457,26243814,,,

,,"&gt; This thread is not full of statistics and data about existing content filtering and surveillance systems and how often they are actually being abused.<p>It is filled with explanations about why the systems you mention are tangibly different from what Apple is proposing. There is a huge difference between scanning content on-device and scanning content in a cloud. That doesn&#x27;t mean that scanning content in the cloud can&#x27;t be dangerous, but it is still tangibly different. There is also a huge difference between a user-inspectable list of malware being blocked in a website and an opaque list of content matches that users can not inspect or debate. There is also a huge difference between a user-inspectable static list and an AI system with questionable accuracy guarantees. And there is a huge difference between a <i>user-controlled</i> malware list that is blocked locally without informing anyone, and a <i>required</i> content list that sends notifications to other people&#x2F;governments&#x2F;companies when it is bypassed.<p>That being said, if you want to look at stats about how accurate AI filters are for explicit material in the examples you mention, there are a ton of stats online about that, and they&#x27;re mostly all quite bad.<p>&gt; nobody has any data or facts about how often systems do slide down slippery slopes, or get dragged back up them<p>There&#x27;s a lot to unpack in this one sentence, and it would take more time than I&#x27;m willing to give, but are you really implying that government surveillance doesn&#x27;t count as a real slippery slope <i>because sometimes activists reverse the trend?</i><p>&gt; Minors will see the prompt &quot;if you do this, your parents will find out&quot; and can choose not to and the parents don&#x27;t find out. There&#x27;s an example of the message in the Apple announcement[1]<p>You misunderstand the concern. The risk is not the child themselves clicking through to the photo (although it would be easy for them to accidentally do so), it&#x27;s the risk of that data being leaked from other phones because a friend thoughtlessly clicks through the prompt.<p>&gt; The open letter itself has multiple inaccurate descriptions of how the thing works by the second paragraph to present it as maximally-scary.<p>Where? Here&#x27;s the second paragraph:<p>&gt; Apple&#x27;s proposed technology works by continuously monitoring photos saved or shared on the user&#x27;s iPhone, iPad, or Mac. One system detects if a certain number of objectionable photos is detected in iCloud storage and alerts the authorities. Another notifies a child&#x27;s parents if iMessage is used to send or receive photos that a machine learning algorithm considers to contain nudity.<p>The only thing I can think of is the word &quot;continuously&quot; which is not strictly inaccurate but could be misinterpreted as saying that the scanning will be constantly running on the same set of photos, and the subtle implication that this scanning will happen to photos &quot;saved&quot;, which might be misinterpreted as implying that this scan will happen to photos that aren&#x27;t uploaded to iCloud. But given that the second sentence immediately clarifies that this is referring to photos uploaded to iCloud, it seems like a bit of a stretch to me to call this misinformation.<p>&gt; people are jumping straight to &quot;horrible governments will be able to disappear critics&quot; and ignoring that horrible governments already do that and have many much easier ways of doing that.<p>Hang on a sec. A little while ago you were calling my fears theoretical, now you&#x27;re admitting that governments routinely abuse this kind of power. You really think it&#x27;s unreasonable to be cautious about giving them <i>more</i> of this power?<p>&gt; Does that change your opinion either way?<p>It does not change my opinion, but at least it&#x27;s real data, so more of that in these debates please. I&#x27;m not denying or rejecting the numbers that the UK lists.<p>&gt; A less panicky &quot;Open Letter to Apple&quot; might encourage them to make that data public<p>Holy crud, I would hope this is the bare minimum. Are we really having a debate over whether or not Apple will make that data public? I thought that was just assumed that they would. If that&#x27;s up in the air right now, then we&#x27;ve sunk really low in the overall conversation about public accountability and human rights.<p>&gt; which seems an important distinction that you&#x27;re glossing over in your position &quot;it won&#x27;t reduce abuse so it shouldn&#x27;t be built&quot; when the builders are not claiming it will reduce abuse.<p>I realize this is branching out on in a different direction, but it sure as heck better reduce abuse or its not worth building. CSAM is disgusting, but the primary reason to target it <i>is to reduce abuse.</i> If reducing CSAM doesn&#x27;t reduce abuse, it&#x27;s not worth doing and we should focus our efforts elsewhere.<p>I know this is something that might sound abhorrent to people, but we are having this debate because we care about children. We have to center the debate on the reduction <i>of the creation</i> of CSAM, the reduction of child abuse, and the reduction of gateways into child abuse. Reducing child abuse is the point. We absolutely should demand evidence that these measures reduce child abuse, because reducing child abuse and reducing the creation of CSAM is a really stinking important thing to do.<p>Which leads back to your other note:<p>&gt; does it make any difference if they involved people the child knew? If so, what difference do you think that makes?<p>Yes, it makes a <i>massive</i> difference, because knowing more about where child abusers are coming from and how they interact with their victims makes it easier to target them and will make our efforts more effective. We should care about this stuff.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not the case that &quot;think of the children&quot; leads to political universal agreement of any system, as you&#x27;re stating.<p>I think you misunderstand. Nobody who&#x27;s willing to bring out &quot;think of the children&quot; as a debate killer has ever dropped the argument because they got a concession. That there are some entities (like the EFF) who are willing to reject the argument as a debate killer and look at it through a risk analysis lens does not mean the unquestioned argument of &quot;one child is too many&quot; is any less toxic to real substantive political debate.<p>&gt; without prohibiting or weakening encryption and in full respect of privacy<p>I don&#x27;t want to bash on the EU too hard here, but it has this habit of just kind of tacking onto the end of its laws &quot;but make sure no unintended bad things happen&quot; and then acting like that solves all of their problems. It doesn&#x27;t mean anything when they add these clauses. This is the same EU that argued for copyright filters and then put on the end of their laws, &quot;but also this shouldn&#x27;t harm free expression or fair use.&quot;<p>It means very little to me that the EU <i>says</i> they care about privacy. What real, tangible measures did they include to make sure that in practice encryption would not be weakened?<p>Look, I can do the same thing. Apple should not implement this system, but they should also reduce CSAM. See, I just proved I care about both, exactly as convincingly as the EU!

,,"To expand on your model, I think our ability to predict success and our ability to predict failure are separate things not on a continuum with each other but orthogonal metrics. We need to count false positives and false negatives here.<p>I predict that HN is no better at predicting success than average. It might be better than average at predicting failure but given the distribution that might not be that hard: if you dismiss every idea AND most ideas fail, then you always look like you are getting it right with a few occasional wrongs. Think about it in the inverse: if most startups succeeded spectacularly but a few failed miserably and you always were bullish on all startups, people would just say that you are almost always right.<p>The only real difference between predicting success and the result being failure and the opposite is that in this world success is unbounded (your valuation isn’t constrained since you can create a whole new market segment), but failure is always bounded. Therefore getting a success wrong sucks more than getting a failure wrong: you could have made a lot of money by correctly predicting a unicorn.",,IgorPartola,,1620342056,2021-05-06T23:00:56Z,comment,27069968,27066721,,,

,,"I bought 0.4 BTC via Coinbase right when the price dipped to $900.  Once the price climbs back to $1200&#x2F;BTC, that&#x27;ll net me $115 after fees.<p>When the price suddenly dives, you may want to consider buying.  It&#x27;s always paid off so far.  It seems like a solid investment strategy, because Bitcoin is still very young.  Therefore it&#x27;s probable that the infrastructure will continue to grow, and it will continue to become more popular over time.<p>It&#x27;s looking like the price is about to enter into a &quot;slow&#x27;n&#x27;steady&quot; phase of growth... I predict it will rise from $1100 to $1500 over the next month or so.<p>Consider this:  If you have $10k lying around, you can set up a Coinbase account and buy 9.5654BTC right now.  Then you can set up an MtGox account and sell those coins when the price climbs to $1500 (which seems pretty inevitable).  Therefore your $10k will become $14,262 after fees, which you can then wire back to your bank account.  $4k is a pretty nice chunk of change, so you may want to seriously consider it.<p>But you must be willing to keep your money in BTC if the price tanks.  It requires a lot of discipline not to freak out and sell.  The overall thing to remember is that BTC will almost certainly hit $1500; it&#x27;s just a matter of when.  So if you have a mutual fund, you may want to redeem it buy BTC instead.<p>Something else to consider:  the price of BTC won&#x27;t be able to double very many more times.  That means an opportunity exists right now; an opportunity that won&#x27;t exist very much longer.  In a year or two, I predict you won&#x27;t be able to count on BTC steadily rising in value.  Whereas you can pretty much count on it between now and then.  Anyone who&#x27;s interested in growing their money on a long-term basis should seriously consider investing now.<p>EDIT:  My comment was written mainly for historical purposes.  A year from now I&#x27;m going to go back to this comment and see how wrong I am.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve been confident in an investment opportunity of any kind, so it&#x27;ll be interesting to see whether that confidence is misplaced.<p>EDIT2:  Don&#x27;t invest any money you aren&#x27;t comfortable with losing, obviously.  But it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ll lose more than half of it.  I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a 95% chance that putting up $10k now will net you $4k sometime in the future, because BTC is only going to grow in popularity and capability, not diminish.  Therefore the question is how long you&#x27;re comfortable with waiting.<p>EDIT3:  Hm, I&#x27;ve hit a nerve.  I wasn&#x27;t trying to tell anyone what to do... but it probably sounded that way.  Sorry.  I was just doing a quick writeup of my own personal thoughts regarding Bitcoin&#x27;s near future outlook.

By how much the trade is going to increase and at what rate is what everyone is arguing about. People underestimate how <i>large</i> Eurasia is along its east-west axis and how underdeveloped it is in parts. I predict the naysayers and doomsayers will be eating their hats.<p>In nominal terms the US is the world&#x27;s largest economy. Let&#x27;s put it at ~$20tn gdp nominal with moderate growth.

The goal&#x2F;desire section was reasonable as a narrow way to rebut people like Musk who go for demon&#x2F;Skynet analogies about human-hating AI.  But, it frustrated me because it seemed to be assigning semantics real-world consequences.  The subtleties of the Chinese Room are by definition unrelated to its (flawless) behavior, so they&#x27;re rather out of place in discussing whether AI is a serious risk.<p>It&#x27;s also possible that you meant that section to say that AI won&#x27;t come up with <i>unexpected</i> desires, or won&#x27;t self-modify.  I think this undervalues the possibility of an algorithm that has self-modification as an (unintended) goal, like Asimov&#x27;s suicidal MultiVac.  I think it also underestimates the ability of a good AI to deal in higher-order reasoning - subjugating humanity is a perfectly good intermediate goal for a paperclip maximizer.<p>2. You did address your last section to exactly this concern, but with all respect I felt like it was a cop-out.<p>You do make one excellent point: too many AI thinkers assume that the unimaginable future will be conveniently close to their imagined one.  Kurzweil in particular should be embarrassed to say &quot;we can&#x27;t predict life after the singularity, but I predict that we&#x27;ll all be happy immortal cyborgs!&quot;  Beyond that, though, I didn&#x27;t find a convincing reason not to fear AI.<p>Declaring something unpredictable is a far cry from declaring it <i>safe</i>, and people like Musk and Bostrom are not pretending to predict the exact course of a post-singularity AI.  Rather, they&#x27;re highlighting possible risks and calling for pre-singularity guidance&#x2F;restrictions.  It&#x27;s gauche to tell stories about post-singularity life, but not to worry about whether we all die in the transition.<p>More broadly, I dislike Wittgenstein&#x27;s sentiment as it&#x27;s typically applied.

Maybe it is because I am inexperienced in most of the topics he discusses in his essays but I am quite experienced in programming.<p>Some reactions to the essay:<p>""I predict a similar fate for Java""<p>It is ridiculous that pg once said he does not know Java at all. Yet he expresses his opinions about it. How can I take his opinion seriously as someone who knows almost the whole language specification of Java by head and had been programming in Java for at least 9 years? It is not only knowing the language which is important. But knowing all those problem patterns that have to be solved at typical enterprise projects. These projects are inherently complicated and has a lot to do with databases (and less with expressing nice and elegant algorithms). Java is not a particularly good language, but without developing a lot for in enterprise projects you really don't know what is needed by those projects. That said my favourite language is Scala. It ihas all the advantages of Java and the Java platform but it is a much better language than Java. It is not a 'pure' language. Pure languages never really do well for widespread practical use.<p>""I think it's important not just that the axioms be well chosen, but that there be few of them. Mathematicians have always felt this way about axioms-- the fewer, the better-- and I think they're onto something.""<p>First the core language in mathematics (the language of first order logic) is orthogonal to axioms. You can have a language with simple syntax (some math books define such a minimalistic language for first order logic), but it will not be good for practical use and will not be concise. So for practical use and for conciseness mathematicians have introduced plently of notations. (e.g. typographical conventions for differentiation, integration, infix syntax for addition, multiplication, etc...), etc. The real-world language that mathematicians use day-to-day is more like let's say Scala than a very pure language.<p>Axioms (and theorems derived from them) are more like libraries. There are plenty of axiom systems: (separate for numbers, geomerty, etc...) The whole mathematics is something like the Java ecosystem: lots of libraries.<p>What pg speaks about is some kind of utopia. A world where all programmers have to do is to express elegant algorithms. But programmers have to solve complex problems which mostly don't have an elegant solution at all. 100 years later we will still not have incredibly elegant solutions for our then hard problems. Even mathematicians don't always have elegant minimalistic solutions for their problems. Andrew Wiles worked for 10 years to prove his theorem. The proof is the result of lots of work and knowledge, and is incredibly complex. It does not fit on the margin at all.<p>Just look at natural languages: they are incredibly useful and concise in some sense, but they are incredibly complex. Programming languages will never be so complex, but they will not necessarily be extremely simple either.<p>Edit: I love minimalism, and I hate convoluted overcomplicated libraries and code bases, and I hate very leaky abstractions. The smaller the code base is the better: this is my main philosophy. But I still think that pg goes too far with his utopia for simplicity.

,,"Physician-scientist here. Current recs from the American Academy of Pediatrics is for both males and females to be immunized for HPV prior to initiation of sexual activity (1). Initially I do believe that the recommendation was only for girls but that has changed for two major reasons: increase herd immunity in the overall population and because men can also get malignancies and lesions from HPV. Of note, the vaccine does not prevent all HPV infections. The 4-valent vaccine covers the two most common cancer-causing HPV strains as well as two others that commonly cause warts.<p>As for whether a test like this would be useful in clinical practice, it would definitely depend on the situation. HPV is extremely prevalent ... by the time a person has been sexually active for a few years, it is almost guaranteed that they carry at least one strain of HPV (there are about 40-50 strains last I checked). However, most people never have any problems related to HPV, either because their immune system effectively suppresses the virus or because they have a strain that does not cause symptoms.<p>Is it useful for one to know that they carry a non-malignancy forming, non-lesion causing strain of HPV? Is it useful for 50% of the population to believe that they have an STI although it will likely never cause any clinical symptoms in themselves or any sexual partners?  I would say probably not. Is it useful to type the HPV strains of all infected patients? Maybe. Currently it would not be useful as we do not have effective antiviral therapies for HPV. However, understanding the epidemiology more clearly could certainly help as we decide which viruses to attempt to target therapeutically in the future.<p>I will say this: the test described in this article would generally be described as a &quot;fishing expedition&quot; in the lab where I did my graduate studies. These types of studies can be very useful in certain cases but I predict they may also cause a lot of confusion as we begin to find subclinical viral processes occurring in plenty of healthy people. As a society, we will have to change our perception of what it means to be &quot;infected&quot; with a virus and as a clinician, it may become more challenging to reassure patients that they are healthy (gut and skin microbiome data will likely create a similar predicament with regard to bacteria).<p>In any case, I&#x27;m sorry to hear about your difficulties with HPV. I see patients dealing with it on a fairly regular basis and it can be a frustrating situation. I do hope that there are effective therapies on the horizon.<p>1. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.aap.org&#x2F;immunization&#x2F;illnesses&#x2F;hpv&#x2F;hpv.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.aap.org&#x2F;immunization&#x2F;illnesses&#x2F;hpv&#x2F;hpv.html</a>",,hanklazard,,1443024444,2015-09-23T16:07:24Z,comment,10265881,10265149,,,

,,"I think your approach is underestimating the reputational cost of a half-baked product. I&#x27;ve seen this with a few products, most recently Roam. I see a product with an intriguing concept, I try it out, and I discover there are some fairly severe limitations. In the case of Roam, it was not having a great way to export data. I then put down the product, and, in all likelihood, I won&#x27;t go back. In addition, I&#x27;ve pointed out this limitation to several friends of mine who had expressed interest, and at least two of them have stated that it was a deal-breaker for them, and that they were significantly less likely to use Roam as a result.<p>To go back to your point, was &quot;lack of export functionality&quot; a &quot;nice problem to have&quot;? Arguably, yes. You don&#x27;t have to worry about exporting data until you have users entering data, right? But, as Microsoft found out way back when it was building Word, users won&#x27;t come to your system unless they know they can get their data back out again to share with others. [1] So just like Word&#x27;s market share only really took off when it was able to write WordPerfect files, I predict that Roam will remain, at best, a curiosity until they implement an export system that allows the user to take his or her notes and use them in a different application.<p>Instead of thinking about problems in terms of what prevents users from signing up, or what prevents users from using the product, it&#x27;s better to think about problems in terms of what prevents users from accomplishing the tasks this product is supposed to help them accomplish. In the case of Roam, the lack of export functionality (which at first might seem like a triviality) is actually a big deal, because the utility of a personal knowledgebase is significantly diminished if there isn&#x27;t an easy way to get all the knowledge back out of it again. As a result, lots products in that space (not just Roam) suffer from marginal adoption because while it&#x27;s easy for a user to sign up, it&#x27;s much less obvious that the product is worth investing any significant time or effort into learning and using.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2000&#x2F;06&#x2F;03&#x2F;strategy-letter-iii-let-me-go-back&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2000&#x2F;06&#x2F;03&#x2F;strategy-letter-ii...</a>",,quanticle,,1597095053,2020-08-10T21:30:53Z,comment,24114226,24113849,,,

What prevents me from buying a 2nd phone and attempting to &quot;restore&quot; it from my friend&#x27;s backup? Do I just have to guess his password? I&#x27;m imagining something like Apple&#x27;s iCloud backups but that service involves a <i>lot</i> of details that need to be right to ensure its security. That costs money, which means users either have to pay in cash or by having their data mined (or both).<p>I predict that the most popular backup service in this hypothetical world would be a free service that leaves user data unencrypted and sells it to 3rd parties.<p>&gt; We will carry with us the fundamental representation of our identity, backed and verified by advanced encryption, instead of cumbersome passwords or logins associated with the same large platforms that control our social lives<p>That&#x27;s great until the battery dies or there&#x27;s a hardware failure or the phone is lost or stolen. Then you have to restore from a backup and that means verifying your identity in some other manner. At some point, identity reduces to a combination of: 1. A password or secret. (Something you know.) 2. A token issued by some trusted entity declaring you are who you claim to be. (Something you have.) 3. A biometric. (Something you are.) Assuming your phone is dead, only option 1 can be used without a 3rd party storing identifying information about you.<p>&gt; Sharing of data, either broadly with a large group or directly person to person, will happen directly between mobile computers, skipping the intermediaries like Facebook or Twitter we’re used to today<p>People&#x27;s phones aren&#x27;t always online at the same time. Sometimes they&#x27;re in a tunnel or on a plane or away from civilization. Given that constraint, who is storing and transmitting the data between the two people?

OK send her this data when she&#x27;s back.&quot; Are they compensated for doing so? If not, why would they run such a service?<p>&gt; Artificial assistance will be local first – for example, searches for the best nearby coffee shop will turn to the nearby network for responses before asking the entire planet<p>I seriously doubt the local network would give better recommendations and results than Yelp or Google Maps, as both entities would sync the local info to their own databases and run their own algorithms on the data. Their results would be a superset of the local data with better algorithms. Who curates the local network&#x27;s results for spam or fake reviews? Why would they have an incentive to do so?<p>&gt; Machine learning will provide personalized intelligent assistance that runs on your own mobile computer<p>I don&#x27;t think that could work. The latest phones have hardware to run ML algorithms efficiently, but they don&#x27;t have the hardware to train them. That requires TPUs and a lot of power. Also you need large data sets to train models. That means aggregating lots of people&#x27;s data.<p>Most people either don&#x27;t understand or don&#x27;t care about the implications of Facebook&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Amazon slurping up information about them. If anything, people prefer it because they get a better experience. Their news feed has more interesting content. Their Amazon recommendations more closely match what they want. Their search results are more relevant. For these people, the current situation is a win-win.<p>I&#x27;m not against this idea, I just don&#x27;t think it has a chance of working. For something new to succeed, it needs to be more compelling than existing products. More importantly, it needs to offer advantages that existing products can&#x27;t copy.

One only needs to glance at the table of content page of any cognitive psychology 101 textbook to see that. Second, it is not clear human&#x27;s perceptual ability is the same as what NN has demonstrated. For example, human&#x27;s perceptual learning is mostly based on unsupervised learning, not supervised like in NN.<p>Finally, his dismissal of &quot;traditional&quot; approach is extremely short-sighted.

,,"You never explicitly stated, but is your argument that the energy consumption of bitcoin is the negative externality?<p>First of all energy is not fungible, not in time and not in space. There are times where consuming electricity is actually beneficial for renewables and the environment. I think the main mental block people have is that are trained to &quot;save electricity&quot; and that &quot;all energy usage is negative.&quot; I would argue that using electricity during periods of wind or solar oversupply is actually positive for the environment. Because of this non-fungibility of energy, proof of work mining can be a positive sum game for the environment. Let me explain:<p>Back in the days where all our electricity came from fossil fuels, I completely agree that marginal electricity usage was bad for the environment. However I think that thought has persisted with us even though it is no longer true 100% of the time. With renewables sometimes the marginal cost of electricity to our environment is near 0 or even negative (eg, during periods of higher winds and lower demand)<p>I predict that in the future as bitcoin mining becomes more and more of an efficiency game that you will see bitcoin mining be kind of a load balancer for the grid, effectively turning off during peak demand (or low supply) times and contributing to the base load during regular times. Of course this would be distributed across the globe, and you would see more plants running midday (with solar oversupply) and overnight (with wind oversupply) than you would during early morning and evening peak hours.<p>For example, it may even help the economics of building new wind plants. Eg, currently it may not be profitable to build a new wind plant because base load is too low that the excess power generated would need to be sold off at 0 or even negative prices. However if bitcoin mining could be turned on during these times and off during periods of high demand, there will need to be fewer peaker plants in operation and it would positively affect the economics of opening a new wind plant.<p>Bitcoin mining only cares about the cost of electricity at a given time, it is not like most other electricity demands that are very time based. With the large variance of electricity generation by renewables, I think bitcoin can in the future help smooth demand according to the real supply&#x2F;demand curve.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like a different implementation of the Tesla utility grid batteries. Instead of deploying power, you force the grid to build more renewable capacity (that the miners are paying for) that you use except in peak periods, where you turn off and effectively provide the grid with more power.<p>Here are 2 articles of a bitcoin mining company doing just this:

,,"If you&#x27;re primarily interested in getting a job, and can cold email a company and get an instant onsite, then going for that is a <i>totally</i> valid option.  The most time-efficient way to get job offers is to get introduced to hiring managers (self-intro if necessary), make a good impression on them, and ask them to jump you along in their firms&#x27; hiring practices.  I&#x27;ve said that here for years; I&#x27;ll continue saying it.<p>There exist many engineers in the world who either a) cannot cold email $DESIRABLE_SOFTWARE_COMPANY and be guaranteed of an interview, b) do not believe they can cold email $DESIRABLE_SOFTWARE_COMPANY and be guaranteed of an interview, or c) are not comfortable executing on the process of emailing $DESIRABLE_SOFTWARE_COMPANY and getting an interview.  Those are three subtly different problems.  We are a partial way to address them, and other problems besides.<p>a) A very talented engineer might not have a resume&#x2F;background&#x2F;etc which pings the radar very hard at a software company.  If you do, great, more power to you.  Try to put yourself in the shoes of someone without a great educational pedigree whose last couple of jobs look something like &quot;IT at insurance company.  Responsibilities: rebooting printers.&quot; or &quot;Network administrator: CISCO routers, light systems administration.&quot;  That person might <i>also</i> be able to black-box cryptosystems, find RCEs in Rails given a day of effort, or program trading algorithms, but the company won&#x27;t find that out because they likely won&#x27;t even be offered a phone screen.<p>b)  You know how impostor syndrome is a thing?  Oh boy, do a lot of very talented engineers have it.  If you can program, many desirable companies like e.g. Stripe would love to make your acquaintance.  If they don&#x27;t offer you a job they <i>will not feel like talking to you was a waste of time</i>.  There are a lot of people who <i>do not get this</i> and benefit from being told some variant of &quot;I understand that you feel like you&#x27;ve still got lots to learn.  I&#x27;ve got lots to learn!  And I&#x27;ve been doing this for 12 years!  But I see from your demonstrable performance that you&#x27;re <i>actually good at this.</i>  The folks at Stripe trust my judgment about this -- if I&#x27;m making a mistake about this, well, that&#x27;s on me and not on you.  Why don&#x27;t you have a call with $PERSON there?  I predict that they are super-inviting wonderful people who will want to geek out with you about tech stuff; if a job offer happens after that, wonderful.  But I can almost guarantee you that no job offer happens without you talking to them.&quot;<p>c)  Many engineers are afraid of selling themselves, for personal reasons&#x2F;cultural reasons&#x2F;etc which our community unfortunately frequently amplifies.  Even if you tell them &quot;All you need to do to get a job is a) meet a hiring manager, b) convince them you&#x27;re not an axe murderer, c) get a coffee date and do your thing, d) say yes to the job offer&quot;, they&#x27;re not willing to take the clearly valuable first step of sending an unsolicited email.  I am totally willing to send a (very) solicited email on one&#x27;s behalf, if I feel like a candidate and a client could have a productive conversation together.  I&#x27;m also pretty good about writing that email.<p>Also: for the right kind of person, the challenges are fun, in the same way that chess or poker or Starcraft or sudoku are fun.

,,"I think there&#x27;s another thing going on here and we&#x27;ve seen a similar pattern before with electrical cars about 10 years ago.<p>Ten years ago was when most of the car industry believed it had decades to adapt to full EV. It turns out that they had much less than a decade. By 2017 most manufacturers were scrambling to accelerate timelines for internal R&amp;D when they realized competitors had other timelines and were about to grab some serious market share. This is now playing out in the market. Several ICE production lines have been shut down (GM, Ford, etc). Most manufacturers have launched or are about to launch full EVs. At this point several manufacturers are putting billions in making mass production happen in the next few years.<p>I predict the same will happen with autonomous driving. Most manufacturers are completely unprepared for it and behind with their R&amp;D. They are actively looking to buy as much time as they can get because they know they won&#x27;t be there. However, some manufacturers are ahead of the curve here and it&#x27;s not just Tesla. When this stuff gets good enough, it means some manufacturers will have a huge competitive advantage over basically everything else. Everything you read about this needs to be put in this context.<p>In other words, some manufacturers are dragging their heels here and it&#x27;s the same manufacturers that are also struggling to adapt to full EV. And they are using the same strategies to manipulate the timelines. Think futuristic looking concept cars that will never drive, lots of lobbying about how cool their R&amp;D is, and a distinct lack of commitment to any timelines, combined with regular reports on serious safety issues that are obviously going to delay everything by decades. That&#x27;s what this article says. What it translates to is: several manufacturers are getting to level 5 autonomy in the next few years and it is going to take decades for everybody else to catch up and mass produce this stuff.<p>Tesla is probably over confident about the timelines but well on track to making lots of progress in the next few years nevertheless. Waymo looks like they are making progress as well. However, they are held back by the notion that they are more of a pure tech play and less of manufacturing&#x2F;logistics play. In other words, they are dependent on the before mentioned manufacturers dragging their heels.<p>IMHO several manufacturers are close enough to solving most of the issues here that there are going to be a few leaps forward in the next few years. These leaps are going to force the agenda for the rest of the industry. Mostly the timelines for autonomous and a switch to full EV are actually aligned.<p>By the time most cars will be EVs, most of them will also be fully autonomous. That&#x27;s roughly 15-20 years from now. Plenty of time to tackle any remaining issues with sensors, snow, and other edge cases. Yes, that&#x27;s hard but people are throwing billions at these problems and making rapid progress. The first level 5 cars might be on the market within as little as 2-5 years. The biggest hurdle here is non technical: legislation. Tesla is being ambitious here (obviously) but even in 5 years they&#x27;d have the market largely to themselves.",,jillesvangurp,,1558409071,2019-05-21T03:24:31Z,comment,19967365,19954704,,,

,,"Why would dependent types not extend beyond pure functions? Idris has both dependent types and non pure functions, is that not satisfactory? The fact that you <i>can</i> write software that provably satisfies a strict specification in dependently typed languages doesn&#x27;t mean that you <i>must</i>. It is perfectly possible to program in them like you would in a normal language. That&#x27;s what I was trying to get at: dependent types are also more expressive, not just more constraining. Now that I know about dependent types I regularly run into situations where I think &quot;gosh, if I had dependent types I wouldn&#x27;t have had to put in these type casts or handle these error cases that I know for sure cannot happen&quot;.<p>So even if you ultimately want to reason about your programs using an external program logic (which I predict we do not, but we&#x27;ll see), then for expressiveness you <i>still</i> want your language to have dependent types for the reason I mentioned above:<p>&gt; Two, type system researchers promote provably correct programming as the advantage of dependent types. IMO the far more important advantage of dependent types is expressiveness and simplicity: they generalize a vast swath of different type system features and extensions to a handful of simple constructs.<p>Furthermore, if you want it&#x27;s possible to use a program logic style of verification in a dependent type system. You can write your program as normal and later prove lemmas about functions in the program. For instance instead of saying<p><pre><code>    reverse : Vec n a -&gt; Vec n a
</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>    reverse : (xs : List a) -&gt; {ys : List a | length xs == length ys}

you can do<p><pre><code>    reverse : List a -&gt; List a

,,"I just tried Kivy.  Thanks for telling me about it!  Kivy is pretty awesome: very easy to use, and it Just Works on all platforms, even mobile.  It&#x27;s also painless to deploy Kivy apps to users, which is great.<p>It&#x27;s hardware accelerated, so I can write my own custom GLSL shaders for the UI, which is pretty cool.  I bet I could even implement a Mario-style game using Kivy.  The main application window is just a GL context, and all the UI widget rendering is done via GL.<p>Unfortunately the Kivy UI seems to be riddled with bugs, and the UI widgets themselves are very alien.  For example, the Kivy file browser widget seems to be incomplete (it lacks basic features) and confusing (it behaves nothing like a native file selector).  So Kivy is probably too jarring of an experience for users... if I use Kivy in its current form, all my users would balk at the unintuitive UI, since Kivy&#x27;s widgets don&#x27;t look or feel anything like native platform widgets.  And since users would also be fighting Kivy&#x27;s UI bugs, I predict every user would immediately ragequit my app.  (E.g. drag-selecting text within multiline textboxes seems to be broken, etc.)<p>That said, Kivy is very close to being an effective way to effortlessly write crossplatform GUI apps.  The main reason to use Kivy is because it&#x27;s so easy to write useful apps with it.  I wrote one in about 15 minutes from start to finish.  The API is a pleasure to use, and the data binding design is especially brilliant.<p>Kivy seems pretty fantastic for writing internal tools. Data visualization via Python is now a cinch thanks to Kivy.  For example, it&#x27;d be easy to write an app that shows the current status of all your server instances.  And of course at that point it&#x27;d be easy to extend your app&#x27;s functionality with features like &quot;right click on a server instance to spawn an SSH session into it&quot;.

,,"Excellent--except all your examples of the &quot;oppositional critiques&quot; have happened, and aren&#x27;t abating. So the concern is well founded. Every day I see people texting, reading, watching videos, and gaming on their smartphones AS THEY ARE DRIVING--navigating traffic, changing lanes, turning, etc. They are so hooked on their devices they&#x27;re unable (or unwilling) to unplug even while driving a multi-ton death machine amongst other multi-ton death machines.<p>The truth is that humans have a tendency to be lazy. It&#x27;s not a simple case of equal substitution; we will happily choose inferior substitutions which require less effort (or expense or time or complexity).<p>Will people choose to &quot;travel&quot; via VR? Yes. Will this reduce real-life traveling? Absolutely. The sense of having been somewhere will reduce our need to actually GO there.<p>I this the rise of VR will see many become thoroughly entranced (addicted?) and less productive and even alive than they were previously. We will see society split into two groups: one large, one small. The small group will be comprised of the productive, who limit their entertainment consumption in any medium (but especially VR). This group will be exponentially more affluent than the much larger group. The larger group will be comprised of the numerous people who already consume what is already available through any medium: Netflix, Xbox, cable, internet, tablets, phones, etc. These are the people who (best case scenario) have a full-time job, but they spend every other possible waking hour watching or playing something. More and more of this group are working less and consuming&#x2F;playing more. And we&#x27;re not talking about real life here. Just think about World of Warcraft--but on steroids. It&#x27;s going to be insane how addictive VR will be once the bugs have been ironed out.<p>In short: I too worry that this is something the human race is not prepared for. I worry that our proclivities dispose us to losing ourselves in it at the expense of our real life and responsibilities.<p>The truth of the matter is that, anecdotally, I look back over my 38 years and I can see the impact on my life of the digital revolution. I <i>want</i> to do more with my life, but oftentimes the allure of the easy &quot;hit&quot; via Netflix or the internet is more of a draw than spending my free time learning languages, exercising, meditating, working on some of my app ideas, writing, or reading. Instead I choose the cognitively easy &quot;hit&quot; at the expense of my personal development and health.<p>Think about smartphones and tablets. They can and sometimes are used for meaningful and productive purposes. They <i>can</i> be very useful tools. But for most people they&#x27;re a distraction and a time suck.

,,"I don&#x27;t think subsidies will be the driving force behind electric vehicle adoption in the US - the lower tax burden and higher discretionary income make them less relevant, especially against the car &amp; status symbol culture. Some of my climate change denying family members switched to a Nissan Leaf some years ago for financial reasons, even with an hour long hilly commute with ~3k feet net elevation change. They got a plan that gave really cheap power at night and really expensive power during the day and came out way ahead even before including the state subsidy - although they drive their cars for upwards of 10 years so the subsidy was a sweat cherry on top.<p>I think the driving force behind EVs long term (decades) will be power companies trying to balance the grid between peak and non-peak loads. What better way to install massive amounts of expensive storage than to put their finger on the scale to incentivize their existing customers to pay for it themselves, all without hurting profits? The big thorn is that the infrastructure to support that is pretty much nonexistent, but there are plenty of steps in between such as smart chargers that only charge the car when signaled to. In California alone, there is potential to sell hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles that can provide backup power during the ridiculous number of blackouts we&#x27;ve had and will continue to have for the foreseeable future as the utilities upgrade their innumerable fire starters (utility poles).<p>Unlike Europe&#x27;s highly integrated grids, the ones in the US don&#x27;t have a network of aluminum smelters, pumped storage, and other industries set up to take advantage of variable power pricing with high enough density.

Maybe they do that on the first alert, at the second one they says who cares, I need to carry on with my business.<p>One could argue that who recieves the notification should not quaraneen but get tested immediately, well we know that we don&#x27;t have the resources to test all these people, in my country they don&#x27;t even test people with symptoms if they are not severe enought, let alone test someone because an app says so.<p>Also an app could give a false sense of security, that is particularly bad. The app only can say if you got in contact with a positive that also had the app, that quite frankly will not be common, first because not everyone has a compatible phone (in my country only 70% of people have a smartphone, also you need an updated phone to install the app, on iOS the APIs that will make it work are just being released in the next iOS beta), then the app will be voluntary and thus not everyone with a compatible phone will install it, for privacy concerns or other reaons (like not being forced to quaranteen for the remote possibility of having been infected).<p>Thus I predict that maybe we are lucky if 20% of people have the app (that is compatible to what happened in the countries that already adopted it).

,,"This is totally off-topic, but your point can&#x27;t be emphasized enough: Both sides of that potential nuclear war went to great lengths <i>not</i> to fire their missiles. Up to and including insubordination by missileers in the silos. Having spent most of my adult life serving in the infantry in various warzones, I have a pet theory about why this happens. The reason we don&#x27;t start a nuclear war is because that would bring the war from the front lines to grandma&#x27;s house. War is a thing that plays to the male psyche of being a kind of exciting grand adventure. This may seem hard to believe for those of you that haven&#x27;t been shot at or shot at other human beings. But after a while, when the urgency of mortal concerns begins to wear off, you can see things for what they really are. I think that war is a very male extension of childhood play. It&#x27;s exciting until faced with one&#x27;s own mortality, and indeed nobody thinks they&#x27;ll be the ones getting blown to pieces. There&#x27;s a great quote by Winston Churchill about being shot at. But I think nuclear war is such an existential thing that transcends conventional warfare to such a degree that no one wants to &quot;play&quot; with destroying the everything.

Ironically it is populist policies that might push automation past the inflection point.  Yes, I am talking about the $15 per hour minimum wage.<p>To a politician this $15 per hour battle cry is great.  They have nothing whatsoever to lose.  It&#x27;s something they can promise and buy votes with that promise.  They can even fight to get it implemented and actually have it pass.  Why?  Because all politicians need votes and this is an easy way to buy those votes from the masses.<p>But, what does this $15 per hour minimum wage do?  And, please, do extrapolate past $15 per hour, because it is in the interest of politicians to keep feeding the drug, even if it kills the patient.  The more miserable the masses are the better for populist politicians.<p>Source:  No less than the entire history of every Latin American country.<p>A higher minimum wage is great for politicians.  They keep their jobs.  They might even ascend the ranks and make more money.<p>For workers?  Bad idea.  Why?  Because there&#x27;s a limit to COGS for a business.  We are in a competitive global economy.  You can&#x27;t sell something for $30 when others are selling it for $15 or $20.  And so, given labor cost hikes, you have very few choices on the table.  Automation and offshoring are two of them.<p>At $15 per hour is likely to cost an employer about $18 per hour in real terms.  That&#x27;s $36,000 per year for someone who will work 2,000 hours per year on average (50 weeks @ 40 hours per week).  If you don&#x27;t understand how this works, here&#x27;s a quick article by a CPA explaining the add-ons:<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cpainerie.com&#x2F;how-much-does-your-employee-actually-cost&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cpainerie.com&#x2F;how-much-does-your-employee-actually-co...</a><p>It goes beyond that.  A forced rise in minimum wage will hike all costs in an organization.  Let&#x27;s take a hypothetical.  I&#x27;ll use Oregon&#x27;s current $9.75 minimum wage because I was just talking to a friend who lives there.  Let&#x27;s say you have a company with the following full time labor arrangement:<p><pre><code>  5 warehouse employees at minimum wage ($9.75)
  10 office employees at $15 per hour
  5 managers at $25 per hour
  3 top level managers at $50 per hour
</code></pre>
Total labor costs for the year, assuming 20% costs above basic wages (see article link provided above) would be:  $1,137,000.<p>Now give the first tier a raise to $15 per hour.  That&#x27;s a 54% raise.<p>The second tier won&#x27;t be happy.  You have to give them a raise.  How much?  Same percentage or same dollar amount?  Let&#x27;s go with same dollar amount.  They go from $15 per hour to $20.25.<p>The other groups are affected as well, so wages go up by the same dollar amount for everyone.  In other words, everyone is making $5.25 more per hour.<p>Total annual labor cost just went up to $1,426,800, about a 25% hike.  An increase of $289,800, of which only $63K was due to the minimum wage workers getting $15 per hour.<p>And, BTW, as you fold Obamacare insurance into this, the numbers are significantly worst.<p>$289,800 is real money.  It&#x27;s $24,100 per month.  Where is that money going to come from?<p>What does a business do?  In a real competitive environment you can&#x27;t have your expenses go up by $24K per month and simply raise your prices.  It doesn&#x27;t work that way at all.<p>Oh, yes, let&#x27;s not forget the other parts of the COGS equation.  I won&#x27;t even try to quantify this one but I&#x27;ll mention it because it is important.  If you source materials and services from other US-based companies and all of them see their wage costs go up by 25% you can bet some of your costs will go up.<p>At this point you are faced with the two options I mentioned above:  Automate if possible or Offshore.  I&#x27;ll add:  Fire a few people to the equation.<p>Well, guess what?  All three of those options produce the same result:  People lose their jobs.<p>Nobody is going to go to Walmart and pay 25% more for a product when the one next to it (probably sourced from China) costs less.  The same with online shopping.  If your product is sold on, say, Amazon or your own website and your competition doesn&#x27;t have to deal with government-imposed COGS hikes, your products will not sell.  People look for good pricing.  They won&#x27;t pay 25% or 50% more so you can keep your employees and pay them more.<p>That&#x27;s the heartless mathematical reality of business.<p>In all of this politicians lose nothing.  They get the masses rattled about inequality and give them the gift of a $15 per hour minimum wage.  They get the votes and continue on a sweet ride in government.  In the meantime, the tsunami starts to build and millions are likely to lose their jobs.<p>Automation is likely to be a solution for a lot of companies.  If a $40K to $100K robot can replace a $15 per hour employee, work two or three shifts and not have the management complexities of a human worker.  Well, guess what, it is very likely it will happen wherever that option makes sense.  Another group will ship jobs to China and a small group will hike their retail pricing because they can and keep the jobs here at a higher wage level.<p>The cold hard truth is that automation in business is purely about the mathematics of running a business.  In a free market there would always be a push-pull where people could find jobs at lower wages if they need them.  By having politicians interfere with this (mostly for their own benefit, because few others will benefit) they probably have succeeded in creating the conditions to push automation through the inflection point and what&#x27;s on the other side isn&#x27;t going to be pink unicorns for everybody.<p>Once the genie is out there is no way to stuff it back into the bottle.  Even scarier than that is low wage countries adopting automation as well.<p>If anyone objects to my conclusion they need to fire-up Excel, go through the simple math I presented and explain why it is that what I predict is wrong.  Mathematically.  I don&#x27;t care about feelings or theories.  You have to show how this would work at the most rudimentary business level without losing any jobs.",,rebootthesystem,,1490826366,2017-03-29T22:26:06Z,comment,13991211,13987417,,,

Not a problem with single request scenarios, but can become an issue with more complex apps.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen front end teams fully rely on the GQL layer to denormalize their data for them and blow 40k requests to 12MB or more. A dedicated backend team as gatekeepers is easier to circumvent, esp if they don&#x27;t have the experience to debug GQL runtime behavior.<p>Then, there&#x27;s the problem that traditional monitoring and acceleration patterns don&#x27;t work with GQL, operationally, as well as with REST.

GQL is a new black box where bad things can happen in secret, if you don&#x27;t know how to expose it.<p>Granted, sane people don&#x27;t necessarily have all of these problems, but the potential for disaster is much greater.

,,"&gt; I mean this: a system is deterministic in practice if you can actually predict its outputs based on its inputs with reasonable amount of effort.<p>You&#x27;re changing the meaning of determinism and bringing it closer to rationalism. Your introduction of the element of theory to the mix is a violation of Occam&#x27;s Razor. We already have philosophy and a word that covers what you want it to cover. Theory is a component of rationalism, not of determinism. If you need theory to understand a system, then it already has elements of non-determinism. Theory is what you need to make sense of the non-deterministic. Because theory deals with uncertainty, you wouldn&#x27;t need any validation of your hypotheses if the system was truly deterministic. One observation would be enough to ascertain the whole thing.<p>A considered study of history would reveal where you&#x27;re going wrong here. The Greeks invented empiricism and philosophy and science while the Egyptians never got there despite only being a tiny distance away. They wanted to distance themselves from theological frames. Despite all this, the Egyptians built pyramids. They understood determinism. They could not understand science. Determinism made them good engineers. Engineering is not science.<p>&gt; A system is deterministic in theory if it&#x27;s deterministic, but actually predicting its outputs requires absurd amount of computation.<p>Now you&#x27;re starting to dip into computational complexity territory. Predicting outputs is the domain that the halting problem puts a backstop to.<p>To prove to you that a brain is better than a computer, all I have to do is state the obvious, humans make algorithms, not the other way around. Sure, there are programs that will devise algorithms, but humans have to understand the domain before they can make computers do their work for them.<p>Your examples of Lorenz systems and weather do not change things at all. Humans have a better understanding of weather than computers do. In fact, humans have an entire body of theory that attempts to make sense of why such things have difficult-to-determine causation, chaos theory. Humans devised it, not computers. And they devised it using the tools of epistemology, working out the details of justification of knowledge via seeking rigor, not in the scientific method of dreaming up hypotheses based on empirical analysis and testing them. Chaos theory is more math than science.<p>In other real ways, humans outclass other mammals, even though we largely share the same macro brain structures. We keep monkeys in cages, monkeys do not keep us in cages.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how much more I have to state the obvious here. You seem to be the one seeking out a special domain in which the rules don&#x27;t apply, one in which computers are wholly analogous to brains. It may, and this is speculation, be true in degree rather than kind.<p>But the halting problem itself illustrates a domain in which humans are able to reason past, whereas we cannot possibly program a computer to do it. Computers cannot program themselves to find gradations of the halting problem. Humans have to write algo-generating algos. The pace of comp-sci progress at the moment is fully dictated by human ingenuity, and if you think about it, any change in this means that the singularity is upon us.<p>I suspect that we&#x27;ll never be able to get computers to fully take the place of brains. There will always be domains where brains are better than algos. Prove me wrong. Humans are capable of wanting things, even the best machine learning algos at the moment struggle with finding purpose. Finding purpose is something even the most basic virus can achieve. And we can&#x27;t even determine whether virii are alive or not.<p>And that&#x27;s super basic. How much more self-awareness do you think algos can find before running into hard physical limits? The computational and memory concerns are huge. I predict the hard limit of engineered systems will be well below full self-awareness. Instead we&#x27;ll have to create biological systems to carry on progress. Dogs will get smarter, mice will get smarter, apes will eventually start doing things that humans do now, once we can fit our ethics around it.",,vinceguidry,,1556245682,2019-04-26T02:28:02Z,comment,19754352,19753205,,,

,,"Modern &#x27;Smart-to-smartstupid&#x27; design evolution:<p>1. Once there were consumer devices with a few buttons and switches.  They really worked and they were amazing.<p>2. Then manufacturers added extra features, and extra buttons&#x2F;switches for them. It was a feature trade war. Extra controls meant better. Everybody wins. Buttons and switches were cheap to make. Manufacturing was intricate and people-intensive but the products were plentiful.<p>2a. These buttons and switches had <i>springs</i> that gave them snap and finger feedback. There were standard leaf switches and generic microswitches, made in the billions, that were fitted with custom caps.<p>3. There was always &#x27;proverbial&#x27; group that always complained that the &quot;extra controls made it too complicated to use&quot;.<p>4. It turns out these complainers were really &#x27;paid consumer focus groups&#x27; that wanted to be in the design loop. We never used to listen to such people in real life, just asshole control freaks whose idea of a certain switch being &#x27;useless clutter&#x27; was actually their lack of understanding of what it did. These are the kind of people today who if you post a specific question on a hacker forum, you get an answer &quot;why would you want to do that?&quot; with no follow through.  But people like this sleazed their way into corporate life.  Their projection of the average consumer &#x27;enraged&#x27; by too many controls was a self-serving myth to keep them into the design loop and introduce dubious measures that created more confusion than saved cost.  We made fun of them and companies that adopted their practices, and continued to buy things with lots of controls.<p>5. Microcontrollers hit the market. Now often the driving logic was digital, but those switches, controls and simple displays were still there and part of the interface. They were polled often enough to simulate the more component-intensive analog experience.  It was the golden age of debouncing.<p>6. Displays became matrix and alphanumeric. Almost at once a drive began to eliminate controls in favor of on screen menus and multi-use buttons. This was a boon to complicated processes like industrial control systems, which always maintained separate essential controls, but NOT so much to those consumer devices. On consumer devices something that used to be a switch was now a hidden menu option. Humans can easily memorize switch positions, but started struggling with menus.<p>7. The fall of modern civilization really accelerated with the PLAY button that was also the PAUSE button, the STOP button that forgets where you had been and &#x27;&lt;&lt;&#x27; and &#x27;&gt;&gt;&#x27; buttons that change their operation based not how long you held it but also how flaky the button is made.  Where once people were angered by membrane and &#x27;chicklet&#x27; button membranes, now people accept them even in expensive devices... with their brief lifespan, and for at least half of the brief lifespan the controls are a source of chronic frustration.  For the shaky and the elderly, constant frustration.<p>8. Displays became color and HD and touch screens appeared. Web site design rejects -- not engineers or people familiar with previous consumer devices -- were hired to populate the screens and build the menus. There is whitespace and visual clutter, too many levels, few if any actual controls, and often used controls are two operations deep.  Onscreen pop-up QWERTY or ABCD keyboards have replaced the simple act of including an actual keyboard with the device, even when it would save frustration in daily use.<p>9. Now Internet connectivity was integrated, postponing a full design cycle even further as devices were released before they could even compete favorable with their previous generations. The Android is probably the best-of-breed of this genre where screen interface and driving logic can be integrated into a brick that is set into other boxes... but at a very steep price.  Few suppliers.<p>10. Its thinness is an affront to the serviceability of previous eras. Small displays on large empty panels and empty enclosures, that once were populated with controls performing immediate functions.  A tiny window into the whole machine.<p>...<p>Because of those switches and buttons, people used to operate devices while doing something else, while looking somewhere else. In the dark, by rote and by habit.  They were &#x27;big&#x27; but big meant real speakers, beefy batteries and things that couldn&#x27;t get lost under a sheet of paper or left on the bus seat.<p>Now you have to gaze intently at a small screen, figure out where you are, stabilize the device to place your fingers just so on a surface that will not work well when wet, squint in the sunlight, fumble while holding things <i>designed</i> to slip out of your hand so the precious glass shatters as it hits the ground... while trying to discern whether present state will accept an operation from pressing a button that isn&#x27;t there.<p>I predict that the next consumer craze will be things that look and operate like they did in the 1980s.",,HocusLocus,,1548643715,2019-01-28T02:48:35Z,comment,19015082,19000890,,,

,,"With free speech it gets interesting how you interpret it. One interpretation, which I think Trump is using, is that &quot;laws come last&quot;. There is a principle that says free speech should be protected and laws only come to cover the cases where the principle can be infringed. So twitter, in this interpretation, would be correct according to current law, but would stand on the wrong side with regards to a higher value of upholding the principle.<p>However there is another interpretation which says that ability to remove someone from your private business is also an expression of free speech. And that private companies as well as individuals are free to choose who they do business with. But there is one nuance here - this is better served under another principle which is &quot;freedom of association&quot;. Freedom of association states that you can refuse to deal with anyone you don&#x27;t like. However in USA this principle recently lost its value after certain group of Christians were not allowed to refuse baking a cake for a gay couple.

Informing and communicating with the public is one of president&#x27;s duties and refusing to send his message infringes upon it. If USA has such a law and if Twitter could be interpreted as a media platform then it could be against the law for Twitter to do what it is currently doing. Unlikely thou, as twitter has a team of lawers and likely they were consulted beforehand.<p>&gt; Zooming all the way out I don&#x27;t see why Twitter really care about such a fight<p>Companies are ran by people and those people take political sides.

,,"MSAs were expanded into HSAs in 2003.  As of now there are some 8 million enrollees.<p>IMO the most interesting effect of the spread of HSAs is the emergence of clinics which forego the overhead of the insurance system altogether[1], dealing with patients directly in a more value-conscious way.  These clinics tend to be both more available (longer appointments, weekend appointments) and more flexible (phone, chat, email communications w/ the doctor).  They also tend to use technology to reduce overhead.  Hello Health doesn't need any support staff for their doctors, rather than the 4-5/doctor average, because they use an online system for managing appointments, communications &#38; billing.<p>I'm pretty excited about the spread of this system - in a month or two, Hello Health will be opening up their web platform to doctors across the country, which will enable them to more easily transition their practices and also provide a facebook/amazon for medicine.

The big bugaboos are unaligned memory access, assembly or X64 intrinsics, and reckless casting.

An effective personal assistant, or office manager, or whatever, effectively begins to read the mind of their employer. Lack of face-to-face, and what I imagine will be a lot of assistant churn, will result in very poor &quot;mind reading&quot; abilities. Cost of training a new assistant is much higher than actually having one, at least for folks who utilize their services a lot.<p>2. A race to the bottom on price, exacerbating the problem of assistant churn. $100&#x2F;hr leaves a lot of room at the bottom, but it&#x27;ll drop to the point where people in the US aren&#x27;t willing to do the job of magic assistant.<p>3. $0 is the cost of Siri, Google Now, and Alexa.

,,"All of this might be true currently, but that&#x27;s because this current first generation &quot;AI&quot; (technically should just be called ML) is mostly bullshit. To clarify, I don&#x27;t mean anyone is lying or selling snake oil - what I mean by bullshit is that the vast majority of these services are cooked up by software developers without any background in mathematics, selling adtechy services in domains like product recommendation and sentiment analysis. They are single discipline applications accessable to devs without science backgrounds and do not rely on substantial expertise from other fields. That makes them narrow in technical scope and easy to rip off (hence no moat, lots of competition, and human reliance and lack of actual software).<p>The next generation of Machine Learning is just emerging, and looks nothing like this. Funds are being raised, patents are being filed, and everything is in early stage development, so you probably haven&#x27;t heard much yet - but these ML startups are going after real problems in industry: cross disciplinary applications leveraging the power of heuristic learning to make cross disciplinary designs and decisions currently still limited to the human domain.<p>I&#x27;m talking about the kind of heuristics which currently exist only as human intuition expressed most compactly as concept graphs and, especially, mathematical relationships - e.g. component design with stress and materials constraints, geologic model building, treatment recommendation from a corpus of patient data, etc. ML solutions for problems like these cannot be developed without an intimate understanding of the problem domain. This is a generalist&#x27;s game. I predict that the most successful ML engineers of the next decade will be those with hard STEM backgrounds, MS and PhD level, who have transitioned to ML. [Un]Fortunately for us, the current buzzwordy types of ML services give the rest of us a bad name, but looking at <i>these</i> upcoming applications the answers to the article tl;dr look different:<p>&gt;Deep learning costs a lot in compute, for marginal payoffs<p>The payoffs here are far greater. Designs are in the pipeline which augment industry roles - accelerate design by replacing finite methods with vastly quicker ML for unprecedented iteration. Produce meaningful suggestions during the development of 3D designs. Fetch related technical documents in real time by scanning the progressive design as the engineer works, parsing and probabilistically suggesting alternative paths to research progression. Think Bonzi Buddy on steroids...this is a place for recurring software licenses, not SaaS.<p>&gt;Machine learning startups generally have no moat or meaningful special sauce<p>For solving specific, technical problems, neural network design requires a certain degree of intuition with respect to the flow of information through the network, which both optimizes and limits the kind of patterns that a given net can learn. Thus designing NN for hard-industry applications is predicated upon an intimate understanding of domain knowledge, and these highly specialized neural nets become patentable secret sauces. That&#x27;s half of the most - the other comes from competition for the software developers with first-hand experience in these fields, or a general enough math heavy background to capture the relationships that are being distilled into nets.<p>&gt;Machine learning startups are mostly services businesses, not software businesses<p>Again only true because most current applications are NLP adtechy bullshit. Imagine coding in an IDE powered by an AI (multiple interacting neural nets) which guides the structure of your code at a high level and flags bugs as you write. This, at a more practical level, is the type of software that will eventually change every technical discipline, and you can sell licenses!<p>&gt;Machine learning will be most productive inside large organizations that have data and process inefficiencies<p>This next generation goes far past simply optimizing production lines or counting missed pennies or extracting a couple extra percent of value from analytics data.

,,"Hi,  I would like to draw attention to the need for trust in AI, in contrast to ethical principles. Ethical principles are a declaration of intent in a specific social context to a specific set of stakeholders (important people, people like us, not people who are &quot;other&quot;). Trust networks and systems provide affordances to people who are excluded from the debate. Individuals develop trust when the interaction that they have doesn&#x27;t produce unexpected harm and when they can inspect the behaviour of systems without having to engage (reveal their needs) and expose themselves to the potential for harm. Complex behaviours can be very difficult for individuals to assess so they need a transparent system that provides proxies that they can understand - a good example is commercial flights - you don&#x27;t know the pilot or ground crew, but the systems of training and qualification allow you to decide that this flight is likely safe. I think that distrust can emerge at a societal scale - see politics for an example - and can be due to generated perceptions.<p>My point is that a declaration of ethical principles is talking the talk - but creating a trusted system is walking the walk. I believe that we will likely see catastrophic failure of AI unless AI researchers and companies develop the infrastructure of trust. I point to Google Flu as an example of where a system failed, in that case the consequence was not painful, but the trust in the Google brand stopped the community from really seeing the failure for a long time. If and when it is discovered that the current generation of oncology and ophthalmic diagnostic algorithms have taken to quietly killing and blinding subsets of the population due to some wrinkle in a deep network I predict a staggering backlash.<p>At that point all the ethical declaration and hand wringing in the world isn&#x27;t going to matter. Expect legislation that takes ML and AI off the table for a generation or more. I was a young fella when the web took off, and I was excited and starry eyed about it. I had no concept of the potential for harm, but this time I do, because I&#x27;ve lived it. We all do, because it&#x27;s out there - and I think that a view that AI is different or that because we have good intent it will work out fine is just not good enough.<p>We have to build AI systems that demonstrably aren&#x27;t harmful and can be controlled by the users and the community that protects the users. This extends into the capability of the infrastructure that is used to construct the artefact to support audit and other inspection affordances; it extends to the behaviours orientation and liability of the people using the infrastructure to make things and it extends to the production infrastructure and management system. At the moment I don&#x27;t see <i>any</i> company <i>anywhere</i> doing this close to right; and it makes me really really mad. I feel especially angry because when I game out the consequences of a big car crash (possibly literally) all I can see is long term harm to the industry and the careers of people of good will, for the want of some short term cost and a bit of professionalism.<p>I have written further on this and I am taking proactive action at work (investing in a standards activity to develop a trustable infrastructure in my industry).

Now, move that crazy&#x2F;stupid&#x2F;complex process to the cloud and surprise, it is very, very expensive. So, yes, the cloud is better, but only for some things. And until legacy applications are rewritten on-premise will exist.<p>One final insight. The cloud costs more. It has been engineered to be so, both from a profitability standpoint(Amazon <i>is</i> a for profit company) but also because the cloud has decomposed the infrastructure of IT into functional subcomponents, each of which cost money. When I was younger, the challenge for IT was explaining to management, the ROI of new servers, expanded networking, additional technology. We never quite got it right and often had it completely wrong. That was because we lacked the ability to account for&#x2F;track and manage the actual costs of an on-premise operation. Accounting had one view, operations had another view and management had no idea really, why they were spending millions a year and could not get their business goals accomplished. The cloud changed all of that. You can do almost anything in the cloud, for a price. And I will humbly submit, that the cost of the cloud - minus the aforementioned profitability, is what on-premise organizations should have been spending all along. Anyone reading this and who has spent time in a legacy environment, knows that it is basically a futile exercise of keeping the plates spinning. On-premise failed because it could not get management to understand the value on in-house IT.<p>As I said, the costs are the same. A gallon of water weighs what it weighs regardless of location. It will be interesting to see, I predict the pendulum will swing back.",,itworker7,,1588832527,2020-05-07T06:22:07Z,comment,23100261,23089999,,,

,,"I used to write software for financial traders, so I&#x27;m more familiar with financial markets and their history than most. It&#x27;s my firm conclusion that consequence-free &quot;financial innovation&quot; is an absolutely terrible idea.<p>Every major market started out with little or no regulation, and every one has ended up with quite a bit. This is true even of self-regulating entities, even of markets owned by traders. Why? Because there are tradeoffs between various market virtues. Openness to innovation is certainly one of them. But not having your money taken by scammers and criminals is another.<p>One of the main things that makes modern financial markets work is <i>trust</i>. If I buy shares of a US-regulated stock, I have some confidence that it&#x27;s not an out-and-out fraud. A great example of this is WeWork. The only reason they&#x27;re not public now is that going public in the US requires a fair bit of tightly regulated disclosure. When the world finally got a proper look at their numbers, the scam unwound.<p>That&#x27;s obviously great for people who might have purchased the stock. But it&#x27;s also great for every company who wants to issue stock to raise money. The more people trust that major-exchange stocks are real businesses, the more readily they&#x27;ll put in their hard-won cash. That&#x27;s good for everybody: investors, entrepreneurs, and the economy as a whole.<p>As we&#x27;ve seen with Bitcoin, unrestricted &quot;financial innovation&quot; leads to a lot of incompetence (e.g., MtGox), market manipulation, and outright fraud.

,,"I predict this post will receive between 2-6 votes and never see the front page, but for what it's worth: this is the most important thing happening in Internet security this year.<p>One of the biggest problems we have in security right now is that nobody knows how many SSL CA's there are. The SSL PKI has failed. Browser vendors allowed top-level CAs to delegate, often for money, their signing authority to third-parties. Those third parties have in turn done predictably horrible things with that privilege. One of them sold a CA=YES certificate to a Fortune 500 company to help them monitor their employees (and also the whole Internet). Several others were hacked.<p>The problem with untrustworthy CAs is that the browser depends on CA trust to ""break ties"" between competing certificate assertions; is this Bank of America certificate BofA, or is it a European organized crime group? The only signal the browser has is which CA the signature on the cert rolls up to.<p>Google ameliorated that problem for its own properties using ""certificate pinning"". Pinning simply means that Google knows what their legit certificates are, and ships a browser, and sure as shit isn't going to let its browser trust some dinky delegated CA's certificate for GMail over the certificate it knows it owns. It sure would be nice if everyone could pin their certificates into browsers instead of just Google and the giant sites Google pins.<p>TACK allows that to happen. TACK is a small cryptosystem that accomplishes for certificate pins what HSTS (a widely supported browser security standard) does for defeating SSL stripping: it provides a way for browsers to see a legit SSL/TLS certificate and then remember that certificate going forward, so even if Iranian hackers (or the NSA) manage to cut a valid-looking CA-signed certificate for that site later on, it won't matter because your browser will only honor the cert it first saw. The technique, which is called ""key continuity"" and forms the entire security model for SSH, relies on the fact that the overwhelming majority of first-contact hits to sites will get their legitimate key; if you're an attacker with an evil certificate, your odds of intercepting a first-touch connection from a browser to BofA is very low.<p>You very much want TACK to get as much attention as it can. Trevor Perrin and Moxie Marlinspike are extraordinarily competent and well-regarded crypto protocol people and TACK is both simple and well- thought- out. TACK takes some of the control maintained by browser vendors back and returns it to site operators. This kind of decentralization is badly needed.

,,"My area of research is primarily post-quantum cryptography, not strict quantum mechanics.

You need logical qubits for polynomial-time cryptanalysis of RSA, and many of them. To get these logical qubits, you need so many more physical qubits that it’s not really productive to map our current records (~50 qubits) to what we’d need.

Nevertheless, in terms of stability XP was a huge upgrade from the dos based varieties in terms of stability which is why people remember it fondly. But especially before service pack 2, many people were sticking with windows 2000 in companies. I had a nice windows 2000 desktop for quite some time at work.<p>By the time they released Vista, it was so horrible that many opted to not upgrade since there was no big need. Especially enterprises said thanks but no thanks and kept on defaulting to XP right until MS pulled the plug on that many years later. They had the same issue with windows 7 and 8. Which is why they made windows 10 a longer term thing and made an effort to get companies upgrading. I predict that this will be an issue with windows 11 as well. Most enterprises like uniform environments and they don&#x27;t want to have to support multiple versions of windows.

,,"A little background on this and a thought:<p>Friction Facts started out as a guy (with an engineering degree) that developed his own test equipment to measure drivetrain losses under load.  He eventually published his own wax formulation so that a DIYer could replicate his best effort at reducing chain friction.  It produced a chain that had about 4 watts of loss, which is pretty good.  That&#x27;s over 98% efficient for a person putting out 250 watts.  250 watts is high for someone that&#x27;s never ridden a bike, doable for someone that commutes by bike every day, and a pro wouldn&#x27;t even break a sweat.  So going to 99% improvement, or &quot;reducing friction by 49%&quot; sounds like a lot, but you&#x27;re only gaining back 2 watts out of 250.  Also, Friction Facts felt really cool when is was just a backyard engineer publishing his results, but then he got bought and took all his results&#x2F;website offline.  Luckily the internet archive and many forum posts have the major results, but it felt kind of like he was selling out to the man.  I understand that he has bills to pay so I&#x27;m not mad at him.  I also understand that a regularly lubed bike chain has higher than 4 watts of loss and most people aren&#x27;t willing to melt wax on their stove to wax their own chains (I do though).<p>The CeramicSpeed concept couldn&#x27;t shift in 2018 and they haven&#x27;t demoed a shifting version as of August 2019.  The pie plate at the back is only for looks, and claiming 13-speeds is totally worthless at this point.  Heck, I could CNC a 30-speed cog for the back, since it would fit inside the diameter of the wheel.  I predict that when a shifting system is functional, it will increase the complexity and add to the friction of the drivetrain, bringing to about the same level of friction as top end chain based systems from Shimano, SRAM, and Campagnolo.<p>This is a promising idea, but ultimately it&#x27;s <i>worth more as a way to avoid patent infringement</i> than it is to make a faster bike.  Another smaller player, Rotor, makes a 13-speed system that shifts hydraulically.  Rotor&#x27;s marketing claims that hydraulics shift better, but everyone knows that it&#x27;s just a way to keep from stepping on the established players&#x27; toes.",,parsimo2010,,1565971507,2019-08-16T16:05:07Z,comment,20716544,20713358,,,

The definition of &#x27;me&#x27; is my prior state.</i><p>There are two problems with this definition of free will.<p>First, it implies that your present self (and future selves) are all entirely subservient to your prior state, and surrounding environment. Ie, the present you has no way of overcoming your past self or your environment. This means that you&#x27;re essentially sitting in a roller-coaster ride, with no levers to pull or opportunity for change. Sure, your past self made the decision to get on the ride. But your present and future self are all helpless from that point on.<p>Second, did even your past have any free will? The chain of causation extends all the way back. Your past self at time T-X is itself entirely subservient to your past self at time T-X-1. Extend this all the way back, and you realize that you&#x27;re subservient to your &quot;self&quot; at the moment of conception. At no point did your consciousness have any ability to change the course of the life that was already plotted for it. If I predict at the moment of your birth, every single thing that will happen in your life and every decision you will make, can you really claim to possess free will?<p>Hence why people try to cling on to randomness and uncertainty. <i>&quot;If the future can be perfectly predicted, people definitely do not have free will =&gt; ergo, if the future cannot be perfectly predicted, then maybe we have free will?&quot;</i> I agree with you though that this is shoddy reasoning.

,,"<i>&gt; The big argument against intelligent life being common (and us not being unique)</i><p>Those are two different things. &quot;Common&quot; is something up for interpretation, especially with the huge numbers concerned. Intelligence being uncommon could still mean hundreds of civilizations active in the galaxy right now. The term &quot;uncommon&quot; allows us to have somewhat meaningful discussions about probabilities. &quot;<i>Unique</i>&quot; on the other hand is an unsubstantiated, almost supernatural, claim of us being the only intelligence in existence anywhere.<p><i>&gt; No civilization more advanced than us is going to let stupendous amounts of energy go to waste in the form of star light.</i><p>That is also a big claim. Yes, a civilization pursuing a maximum energy strategy would probably harness stars, at least from our current technological perspective that seems reasonable. However, very few people looking for signs of this would actually claim that <i>all</i> civilizations more advanced than us <i>must</i> do this. So originally at least, this hypothesis was proposed under the more reasonable premise that for purposes of detection it would be enough if <i>one</i> such civilization pursued this strategy. Again, the claim that all of them would necessarily do this seems needlessly extremist.<p><i>&gt; You require a planet with an extraordinarily stable climate to allow a technological society to evolve and I predict this is the filter.</i><p>There is a good chance you&#x27;re at least somewhat correct, but then again I can easily imagine planets with a way more stable history than Earth had.<p>A sample size of one is always going to be a problem, especially if you lack the means of even knowing what to look for. Making absolutist claims a priori seems to me like an argument to stop looking. Historically, claims of uniqueness and specialness have had a tendency to be wrong. It seems to me like a good default stance is to assume that whatever we see in front of us has a chance of occurring that is significantly higher than zero.",,Udo,,1470097136,2016-08-02T00:18:56Z,comment,12207088,12206569,,,

,,"I agree. Qualcomm is dominant, but not quite &quot;Intel-dominant&quot; in mobile, especially when Apple makes another few hundred millions chips of its own.<p>That said, it&#x27;s becoming increasingly worrisome that so many OEMs just &quot;default to Qualcomm&quot; these days. If I were Samsung&#x27;s CEO I&#x27;d put much stronger focus on making my own chips and putting them in my own devices (just like Apple), while <i>also</i> selling them to others, just like they sell their Super AMOLED displays and so on. I would also buy out AMD, mostly for their GPU expertise, but also to enter in the server&#x2F;data-center market, which is more profitable than the mobile market. Samsung has the money and marketing clout to do much bigger things than AMD can do right now alone.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the hell Nvidia is doing in mobile, but they always seem to screw something up. Their non-focus on energy efficiency in &quot;mobile&quot; and their focus on &quot;performance&quot; for umm..<i>tablets</i>, has proven to be a mistake <i>with every single chip generation</i>. Stop it, Nvidia! You need to win smartphones, not tablets, which are a dying breed already. And to do that you need low-end chips as well not just &quot;PC-class mobile chips&quot;, otherwise you&#x27;ll <i>never</i> get the market share you need to help you become &quot;popular&quot; in the mobile market.<p>And finally Intel - oh, Intel, how I despise thee. Two main reasons why I don&#x27;t want Intel to win even 5 percent of the mobile market. Short version: 1) they are anti-competitive, 2) they don&#x27;t deserve it.<p>Long version - Intel has started having quite the &quot;monopolist culture&quot; a while ago (at least a decade). They&#x27;ve learned that playing the monopolist card when in power &quot;works&quot; (to crush competitors and entrench themselves in the market), and they try to use it as often as they can and to the limit of the law (or even well beyond it, if no one is paying attention). Intel has almost wiped out GPU vendors from laptops through strongarming of OEMs and shady pricing tactics and, with Broadwell and Skylake having an even bigger focus on GPU performance, I predict within 2 years no one will even hear about an Nvidia GPU in an Intel-based laptop (unless we&#x27;re talking $2000+ machines - maybe).<p>They also have a monopoly in CPUs for PCs and are now using the profits they get there to sell their their Atom chips <i>below cost</i> (a practice that&#x27;s <i>illegal</i> in many countries, but either they aren&#x27;t paying attention or Intel manages to twist that into some kind of &quot;business deal&quot; they are making with OEMs).<p>That&#x27;s just the anticompetitive part. The &quot;don&#x27;t deserve it&quot; part comes from the fact that Atom sucks compared to the highest-end ARM chips, even though it&#x27;s built on 22nm FinFET, and those ARM chips are built on 28nm planar (if we&#x27;re to compare them at the time of market launch) - essentially a 3 year&#x2F;one node and a half process advantage for Intel. So they are trying to push bad products into the market and gain market share by selling them below cost to trick some OEMs into accepting their chips. And I say &quot;trick&quot; because that&#x27;s what it is - at best, a short term advantage of them, because if Intel would ever have even 20 percent of the mobile chip market, those same OEMs would have to pay them more than what they pay for ARM chips, because it&#x27;s &quot;Intel&quot;.<p>So many other shady Intel practices such as tricking consumers into thinking &quot;Celeron&quot; chips are Celeron, when in fact they are Atom, lying about the <i>real</i> TDP&#x2F;power values of their chips to make it seem like their PC chips are almost comparable to ARM (while being misleading about the fact that they also have much lower performance) and so on. Intel is a shady company through and through when it comes to selling its products.",,higherpurpose,,1420394429,2015-01-04T18:00:29Z,comment,8835181,8835080,,,

I would not at all characterize the modern internet as heading toward less freedom, not at all. My impression is that far more people are far more aware of issues of injustice and oppression today than was previously the case. It used to be that only a tiny sliver of &quot;radicals&quot; were really clued into those issues, and many of them also adhered to one or another nonsensical conspiracy theory to boot, which weakened their cases when it came to appealing to the modern world. Today I see growing kernels of increasingly less marginalized and increasingly more powerful people who have been educating themselves, participating in the conversation, and speaking out.<p>No it&#x27;s not perfect, and it&#x27;s not happening absent a lot of the revelation of lots of repugnant behavior. And it&#x27;s also happening seemingly very, very slowly. But my perception is that the trend is for the most part in the right direction and strong. Giving up is the only sure way to lose at this point.<p>The bulk of this article seems to be completely out of touch with the way people have been using the internet, especially younger people.

That only appears to be the case when you look at bullshit measurements based on bogus statistics like paper valuations and user counts. The reality is that the real power is in the people. In the content creators, in the groups, in the social networks themselves. The value layered on top of that or spread in-between to facilitate it is fragile and small by comparison. It&#x27;s the same as in Silicon Valley. Having a billion dollar valuation doesn&#x27;t mean your company is powerful or secure any more than having a billion users does. And it doesn&#x27;t.<p>I predict that within the next 5 or perhaps 10 years there will be another great shift and &quot;implosion&quot; of one of the current major &quot;internet powers&quot;.

Here&#x27;s why.<p>Terrestrial marketed energy consumption will increase by one to two orders of magnitude due to an explosion in photovoltaic production.  The cost of photovoltaic panels has been dropping exponentially for 40 years, which was hard to notice when photovoltaic energy was still more expensive than energy from other sources — it was still restricted to marginal uses where grid power wasn&#x27;t an option, like Joey&#x27;s house.<p>Unsubsidized photovoltaic energy is now cheaper than energy from coal or oil in all of the tropics and a substantial part of the temperate zone; this started around 2016, but it&#x27;s gradually spreading to more and more of the planet as photovoltaic costs continue their exponential descent.

Probably as long as there are places to install photovoltaic panels (which total hundreds of times current world marketed energy consumption), materials to construct them (which are abundant), and demand for the energy — the only real possible bottleneck during the next several decades.<p>So I predict one to two orders of magnitude increase in world marketed energy consumption by 2118.  Three orders of magnitude is not out of the question.",,kragen,,1546019869,2018-12-28T17:57:49Z,comment,18778277,18772563,,,

,,"This case has nothing really to do with the claim of the named plaintiff. If being brushed off after a brief interview, etc. and similar skimpy items were the criteria for filing a claim for age discrimination, the courts could be loaded with such claims. There is basically zero evidence from the interaction noted in the article to make for a sustainable claim of this type.<p>No, this is all about class action procedures.<p>1. As in most such cases, the named plaintiff is there only to satisfy the technical requirement that a representative be named to represent the class.<p>2. The underlying claim, then, in the absence of any direct proof of discrimination in any given case, is based on an &quot;effects&quot; theory: Google stats show that it has an average workforce whose age is considerably lower than what other stats show is the average age of computer programmers; this &quot;proves&quot; that latent discrimination is happening; ergo, the class is entitled to massive damages because Google&#x27;s hiring practices single out older people and treat them unfairly by rejecting them as job applicants on unlawful grounds.<p>3. Google recently settled an age discrimination case in which there appears to have been real evidence that they treated an older worker unfairly. This case now seeks to take the evidence in that one instance, combine it with stats evidencing a young workforce at Google, and hope this is enough to justify the class action claim.<p>4.

In other words, it is a fishing expedition.<p>No particular sympathy here for Google. I am sure it does treat older workers unfairly at some level. The tech industry does this across the board.

,,"I&#x27;m shocked by how many liberals who really ought to know better are cheering for the deployment of corporate oligopolistic censorship at this scale. We&#x27;re not talking about just kicking someone off Twitter... now we&#x27;re talking about kicking them off supposedly neutral public cloud platforms.<p>This is a major escalation and honestly it&#x27;s changing my mind a bit about the whole issue. I was a fence sitter before but now I&#x27;m siding with the libertarian crowd on this one, and I say this as someone who is nowhere near the alt-right politically.<p>We&#x27;re going from what amounts to forum policing (though on huge scale quasi-public forums) to <i>infrastructure level</i> censorship. No longer can you just &quot;go set up your own site.&quot; Even more significantly we are seeing an incredible amount of coordination between corporations on this, proving that competition and diversity in the marketplace is not sufficient to protect the openness of the Internet as a system.<p>Once again: liberals really should know better, especially any that care about net neutrality. This is a really extreme example of ISP traffic discrimination and <i>it sets a precedent</i> that this kind of thing is okay. A top level infrastructure provider blackballing a site for speech should be a third rail regardless of the content in question.<p>Censors always start with the least popular ideas and speakers. They do that for a reason: they want to gauge what they can get away with and they want to shift the Overton window toward increasing support for censorship. They know that few people will overtly stand up to defend Nazis, trolls, and blithering red faced demagogues, so that&#x27;s where they start. Other popular targets in the past included pornographers, lewd writers and musicians, and religious blasphemers.<p>Two thoughts that ought to keep you up at night even if you are inclined to agree with these moves:<p>(1) What happens if&#x2F;when the political winds shift and someone like Donald Trump or maybe someone even to the right of him ends up in control of these powers? Who gets silenced then? A power once created becomes a political entity that can easily be handed off.<p>(2) What happens if&#x2F;when some liberal cause -- like a reboot of unionization and a new labor movement for example -- really threatens corporate and Wall St. profits at a large scale? Will Neo-unionists get this deplatformed and shadow banned now that it&#x27;s been legitimized? Will anyone even notice?<p>Again... we are <i>setting a precedent here</i> that this is okay. You really all ought to know better. The reference metric for freedom of speech is the freedom enjoyed by the most offensive and least popular speakers: political fanatics, pornographers, demagogues, hate-mongers, etc. If they are free to speak then you are free to speak. If they&#x27;re not then the process of clamp-down has started and you are next.<p>There&#x27;s a reason the ACLU has in the past defended neo-Nazis and other unpopular speakers, and it&#x27;s not because they support these speakers&#x27; messages. It&#x27;s because you need a canary in the coal mine.<p>Edit:<p>The conspiracy nut devil that hangs out on my shoulder whispers that this combined with the abolition of net neutrality is a coordinated campaign. Use massively unpopular triggering demagogues to get the left to abandon its commitment to free speech while simultaneously using fallacious libertarian arguments to get the right to eliminate net neutrality. Put those together and you have a Great Firewall of America and enough public support from a broad enough subset of Americans to deploy it.<p>(The libertarian arguments against NN are fallacious because ISPs are government backed and sometimes even <i>funded</i> monopolies.)<p>The next ratcheting up would be for peering points to refuse to <i>peer</i> Internet traffic that they don&#x27;t like, and abolition of net neutrality would allow that. That means Gab (or tomorrow moveon.org, who knows) couldn&#x27;t even host at an indie hosting provider or overseas.<p>But that&#x27;s crazy talk right?<p>If sites like Gab get banned from being hosted the next step for them will be to move to decentralized platforms or Tor. If the above is true I predict that this combined with the words or deeds of a few nutjobs will be used to start convincing both liberals and libertarian-minded conservatives to start supporting bans on un-escrowed encryption as well as ISP and cloud provider efforts to block &quot;horizontal&quot; network traffic.

,,"&gt; Again, stop moving goalposts. Your comment was &quot;why can&#x27;t they just put it on FTP&#x2F;WWW without support&quot;. That&#x27;s exactly what they do.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what they don&#x27;t. You&#x27;re the one who innocuous altered that to &quot;without support and updates&quot; which you know very well makes all the difference. If CentOS had the same non-update schedule as developer-RHEL, approximately nobody would use it in production. Contrawise, if RHEL did provide timely yum&#x2F;dnf updates (and remove the murky &quot;Development Use&quot; clause), everyone would run that instead of CentOS. So now you&#x27;re telling me to stop moving the goalposts back after you moved them to another field?<p>&gt; You aren&#x27;t required to register it in any way, including downloading.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m a bit dense, but I clicked on every download link on your page and they all led me to &quot;Log in to your Red Hat account&quot;. Maybe you can post a direct URL to the ISOs?<p>&gt; You want a free &quot;product&quot;. That isn&#x27;t their business model. At least they make the sources for everything available, which took Canonical years for Landscape.<p>No, <i>I</i> don&#x27;t want a free product. I was stating from the first post that Red Hat Inc don&#x27;t want people to have that. Which I&#x27;m completely fine with and fully support. You seem to be in complete agreement, so I don&#x27;t know why you bothered with  some quasi-rebuttal in the form of freebie Developer RHEL link which is very different from the CentOS&#x2F;Rocky proposition.<p>&gt; [details about the build process]<p>Ok, maybe the debranding part is not a big deal, I don&#x27;t know. But my point only rests on the process being labour-intensive, hence expensive. Which I don&#x27;t know you&#x27;re disputing or agreeing with. If a CentOS rebuild is necessarily labour-intensive, I don&#x27;t see a bright future for Rocky or similar projects. I think it is, since AFAICT almost every clone except Oracle gave up trying to keep up with RHEL 8. It&#x27;s hard to prove things either way, but we&#x27;ll find out soon enough if we follow the Rocky project.<p>&gt; You inverted this argument and you&#x27;re asking the wrong questions. The question isn&#x27;t &quot;why aren&#x27;t people moving off CentOS?&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;why did they use CentOS in the first place?&quot;
It&#x27;s because they were already familiar with RHEL from previous jobs,<p>So inertia &#x2F; legacy &#x2F; switching costs, we&#x27;re exactly in agreement.<p>&gt; and wanted familiar tooling (apt may be nicer than yum was, but dpkg is a dumpster fire for package maintainers compared to RPM, and RPM&#x27;s tooling is much more cohesive than digging around in 10 different manpages for apt-cache || apt-file || dpkg -L || whatever to get information). Kickstart is nicer in many ways than preseed. Sure, the costs of swapping all of that are non-trivial both in the time investment for administrators to rewrite tooling and for the marginal loss in productivity until they re-learn tooling.<p>Now this is a completely different argument, that the RHEL&#x2F;CentOS tooling are intrinsically superior to Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu&#x27;s. I&#x27;m pretty skeptical, since it implies that organizations who do run Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu could save a lot by switching to CentOS and a bit of retraining. But this is of course not a dispute that&#x27;s going to be settled in a thread like this, so let&#x27;s leave it at that.<p>&gt; [something about containers, OpenShift, K8s, divining Red Hat&#x27;s Grand Strategy]<p>This does not seem on topic, so no comment.<p>Maybe I just expressed myself badly, so let my try again. I predict that Rocky Linux will not be a big success, and don&#x27;t think doing a free-beer RHEL clone (CentOS as most users understood it) is a worthwhile endeavor, despite a seemingly large audience. Yes, giving good stuff away for free is popular (and I do believe RHEL is a good product). Because  they&#x27;re largely dependent on RH, who 1) appear not very enthusiastic about the idea of people running RHEL for free even without support, 2) can largely determine how expensive running a clone project will be.  That&#x27;s why IMO it&#x27;s better to analyze if users really need a strict RHEL clone, or if what they want from it (xLTS, better tooling, commercial software compatibility, whatever) could be better developed on top of Debian, whose incentives seem to class less. 
People who really really need a RHEL clone: time to pay up or go with the Stream (it probably really not-so-bad).<p>Now unlike you I have zero inside knowledge or experience, so maybe I&#x27;m just talking out of my ass. But I am willing to make a somewhat falsifiable prediction, that Rocky and similar clone projects don&#x27;t have much chance of success.  Maybe I&#x27;m all wrong and Rocky can with a handful of volunteers and some clever scripts, resurrect CentOS-as-people-understood-it. Or maybe some deep-pocket 3rd party with a better brand than Oracle will step up. We&#x27;ll find out a year or so.",,em500,,1608231865,2020-12-17T19:04:25Z,comment,25459010,25455147,,,

,,"&gt; I predict that 10 years from now normal relational databases have infrastructure for shared, authenticated and verified rows and columns<p>Agreed, though with the caveat that this is for transactional systems closer to the settlement&#x2F;long term storage layers where the added assurance is useful. The performance hit for a traditional (linear) log is too large otherwise... though you can do a causally consistent version instead to reclaim some of the performance. But for more analytical workloads, I doubt it.<p>I&#x27;d actually go one step further and predict that in 3-7 years we&#x27;ll start seeing early-stage startups, in fields completely unrelated to blockchains, using a smart contract enabled enterprise (private) blockchains for the majority of their backends... dropping most of the backend application layer (currently filled by django&#x2F;rails&#x2F;etc) in favor of a Vue&#x2F;React &lt;=JSON=&gt; private blockchain arch.<p>The _reason_ such a shift might make sense is what you get in return:<p>- distributed w&#x2F; BFT (no _there&#x27;s a problem with one of the nodes in the etc.d&#x2F;consul cluster and its down&#x2F;screwy_ problems)<p>- complete commoditization of high availability + disaster recovery<p>- good enough un-sharded write performance (a few 1000 tx&#x27;s a sec) with unlimited read performance (writes are the expensive part)<p>- high-security env comes for free<p>That being said, the current state of smart contracts (specifically solidity but also plutus and tezos&#x27;) makes this prediction laughable as, at the moment, writing&#x2F;writing safe blockchain apps is quite difficult.

Moreover, when you write a contract in Pact you get, for free, a REST API (pact types have native JSON reps) + an RDBMS representation. As if that weren&#x27;t enough, it has a H-M type system (opt-in) + formal verification.<p>The only way this prediction can happen is if the smart contract language is far more effective at traditionally app-layer roles (e.g. django, rails).

I would wager that there are few engineers who are really, truly passionate about Oracle or Salesforce, but for some reason people still get excited about Google, Facebook, or the next Uber-for-dogs startup.  This means that the latter category get an entirely different kind of value from the skills of their engineers.<p>If you&#x27;re a good programmer, you can optimize for various different things- getting something done quickly, writing pretty code, making the boss happy, following every last implied detail of spec, or, importantly, <i>making the software as useful as possible</i>.  What you need is for an engineer to be able to think, &quot;well, bossman won&#x27;t necessarily like it and it will take another ten minutes, but I should write this in this specific way because I predict it will prevent some problems if this code gets reused in certain contexts.&quot;  There are innumerable small things engineers can do solve problems that <i>might happen</i>, but no salary can incentivize them to do this (or even to look for the opportunities to do so) since there&#x27;s effectively no way to tell if they&#x27;re doing it- engineers who don&#x27;t care will likely be optimizing for making their bosses happy, so engineers who do care will even often seem <i>worse</i> according to any effectiveness metric the company employs.

,,"The thing you are not considering here is that in this world of censorship you now need a &#x27;Ministry of Truth.&#x27; Let&#x27;s consider Google and the NYTimes. The NYTimes was one of the loudest cheerleaders for the war in Iraq. They unquestionably ran stories advocating and spreading our likely fabricated &quot;evidence&quot; even though a critical examination would likely have revealed some serious questions, but they chose either not to investigate or not to ask those questions. They, years after the fact, wrote an article condemning their own lack of scrutiny [1]. But did they really learn anything? They returned to the exact same pattern of unquestioning cheerleading for war in Syria, and I predict we&#x27;ll likely see something similar should our actions in Venezuela culminate in yet another invasion.<p>Google is a massive multinational corporation that profits by harvesting and exploiting personal individual on people. They have shown an eagerness to expand their operations to countries such as China. They planned to launch a censored search engine and were happy to agree to record and track individuals by tying their search to their phone number. Such behavior would enable convenient tracking and &#x27;correction&#x27; by Chinese officials if they so desired. Among the list of terms they included in their prototype for China was literally &quot;human rights.&quot; [2].

I&#x27;m also concerned by how few of my questions you actually answered.<p>&quot;SSH in and get caught messing with the system manually&quot; is an extremely hand-wavey answer, especially in an environment of O(1e6) machines. I&#x27;d expect such an environment to have a rather significant degree of automated compliance and audit controls in place.<p>You&#x27;ll also note well that I didn&#x27;t say not to service machines. I&#x27;d asked why you would prefer to leave a machine with an implied potential data-destroying fault in the rack than immediately swap it out with a new machine that has been verified not to destroy data. The servicing part comes into play here in order to mark the previous-faulty machine as no longer faulty.<p>In particular, rack space is expensive, and certifying a machine as fit for service again can take a long time, so it&#x27;s a bit of a waste of real estate to leave a machine that can&#x27;t serve production traffic in place when you can quickly swap it out with one that can.<p>Furthermore, redundancy doesn&#x27;t help when you have an HBA or an ethernet controller or a memory controller or CPU or a piece of PCIe interconnect hardware or a hard disk with a firmware bug that corrupts data. At that point, your redundancy becomes a liability, and you could wind up propagating corrupt data throughout your system.<p>This all said, I&#x27;ll agree that the louder and more obvious hardware faults like disk crashes are relatively easy to cope with, so in those cases, I&#x27;d likely also leave the machine in the rack and just perform the respective component swaps. The place where I predict we&#x27;ll disagree is whether to evacuate the machine&#x27;s workloads prior to servicing.<p>So, again, I&#x27;ll assert that you likely have less of a hand in the engineering of these things than you&#x27;re letting on. That&#x27;s nothing to be ashamed of, but it does make your responses seem less genuine when you try to pass off your experience working in such an environment as expertise in designing such an environment.",,nrr,,1581634608,2020-02-13T22:56:48Z,comment,22322241,22319723,,,

These campaigns are not consuming Kickstarter’s traffic and brand, they’re contributing to it.<p>And whatever we might think of using words like “hologram” for this magic pixie-dust product, the odds are reasonable that <i>something</i> will ship to the backers, so Kickstarter’s reputation is less likely to be tarnished by a VC-backed campaign than by a truly independent project where they don’t have the budget to hire an experienced team.<p>So from Kickstarter’s perspective, well-funded “crowd-funding” campaigns that are actually marketing stunts is very good business, and I predict they are going to shift more and more of their emphasis this way, just as consumer-facing companies often gradually shift to becoming enterprise-facing companies.<p>As a prospective backer, this is far less attractive to me, so I am not advocating for this shift.

,,"I think you and those responding to you are saying many valid things, but there are ambiguities still. Does &quot;dating&quot; mean &quot;late-stage worried-about-dying-alone parents-nagging-me dating&quot;? Or does it mean &quot;screw around and go where the wind takes me?&quot;. Is the context online or offline?<p>I think &quot;looks win&quot; accurately describes the way many women select men online for many of their dating years, but it can&#x27;t continue forever. The &quot;20% of the men get 80% of the women&quot; works in short term dating, but it won&#x27;t work out for more permanent relationships. From 100 men and 100 women, 20 men would pair with 20 women, and you have 80 men and 80 women left over. So they start to change preferences as they get older. And women know that a man can have a trait that&#x27;s useless in the bedroom but very useful when raising a child.<p>It&#x27;s also hard to say what &quot;4th most important&quot; means. Maybe looks are the 4th most important thing, <i>given that the man is, at a minimum, in the top X%</i>. But what&#x27;s the formula? There are nonlinearities also, i.e. you can&#x27;t always compensate. Having a million dollars and being 5.5 feet tall is better than having a billion dollars and being 4.5 feet tall, I&#x27;d predict. Something can be low-importance, but just about anything can be a dealbreaker.<p>I think you&#x27;re correct in saying the gender inequity isn&#x27;t so terrible at the end of the day. I predict if you surveyed both genders about whether they get what they <i>really want</i> out of online dating, they&#x27;d largely say no. Yes, the average woman has lots of options on Tinder, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the average woman enjoys using Tinder much. Men think women have it great online because the women have what men want - lots of choice. But I have many female friends who are depressed about dating despite their long list of suitors. They struggle to build satisfying connections. We could ask who is to blame, but I&#x27;ll just note at the end of the day, one side might be slightly happier than the other ... but only slightly!

,,"&gt;Which existing neuromorphic computers achieve 10^14 ops&#x2F;s at 20 W? If you compare them to GPUs, those &quot;ops&quot; better be FP32 or at least FP16.<p>The comparison is of 3 bit neuromorphic synaptic ops against FP8 pascal ops. That factor is important (as it means that the neuromorphic ops are less useful), but it turns out to be dwarfed by the answer to your second question:<p>&gt; Also, you forgot to tell us what is that &quot;extremely concrete reason why current neural net architectures will NOT work with the above optimizations&quot;.<p>this is rather difficult to justify in this margin. But the idea is that proposals such as those above (50 Tops) tend to be optimistic on the efficiency of the raw compute ops. But these proposals really don&#x27;t have much to say about the costs of communication (e.g. reading from memory, transmitting along wires, storing in registers, using buses, etc.). It turns out that if you don&#x27;t have good ways to reduce these costs directly (and there are some, such as changing out registers for SRAMs, but nothing like the 100x speedup from analog computing), you have to just change the ratio of ops &#x2F; bit*mm of communication per second. There are lots of easy ways to do that (e.g. just spin your ops over and over on the same data), but the real question is how to get useful intelligence out of your compute when it is data starved. This is an open question, and (sadly), very few ppl are working on it, compared to say low-bit-precision neural nets. But I predict this sentiment will be changed over the next few years.<p>Edit for below: no one is suggesting 50 Top&#x2F;w hardware running alex net software to my knowledge (though would love to hear what they are proposing to run at that efficiency) . Nvidia among others are squeezing efficiency for cv applications with current software, but this comes at the cost of generality (it&#x27;s unlike the communication tradeoffs they&#x27;re making on that chip will make sense for generic AI research), and further improvements will rely on broader software changes, esp revolving around reduced communication.

,,"The app store for ios has exerted massive negative price pressure on apps, including creating a norm of free or $1 apps.  I know it's basic psychology, but it still amazes me that tons of people using a $200 phone that costs on the order of $80/mo to use bitch endlessly in reviews and negatively rate apps for charging the ginormous price of $3.  Or something equally out of line.  This is exacerbated by shitty discovery in the app store.  There's massive returns to being on the top app in category X list, and that's very difficult to do at higher prices.  Plus you can't create paid upgrades without creating a new product in the app store, forcing you to start from zero with marketing and list rank.  I predict the mac app store will likewise exert downward price pressure on app prices.<p>Sparrow is really really cheap.  A generation ago I used eudora, which cost $50 to $100, for email.  So between the mid to late 90s and 2012, the price fell something like 80 to 90 percent to $10 for the mac program.  The above is worsened by the rise of decent free email clients since it diminishes the audience.<p>If you do the math, you have to sell a fuckton of $2.10 cent apps to afford salaries for good developers: say four people at $200k/year fully loaded (salary, health insurance, ss, medicare, office space, internet, diet coke, coffee, macbooks).  That's 380k sales just to tread water.  And we didn't deduct marketing expenses which are probably significant: you'll have someone fulltime doing seo / sem / banging on blogs and reviewers to get organic / etc.  Plus, again, Apple has created a norm where apps get updated forever for free.  So that $2.10 is close to being a <i>lifetime</i> value for a user.  That means you probably can't use sem for user acquisition: a <i>wildly</i> optimistic 10 percent clickthrough <i>and purchase</i> rate (an order of magnitude high for most things) and 20 cents per click (also wildly cheap) puts you at $2.00.<p>I presume Apple does this because of classic economics: increase demand by decreasing the price of complements.  But if developers can't get paid, users can't have nice things.  And I'm not an ios or mac dev, but looking at the interactions in their apps, they seem super custom.

,,"web.go is old and not maintained. If you&#x27;re new to Go and wants a framework check out beego (<a href=""https://github.com/astaxie/beego"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;astaxie&#x2F;beego</a>). The other popular framework is Revel which I think is &quot;too heavy&quot; and not my cup.<p>beego, revel are adaptation from other languages&#x2F;framework, beego is Python&#x2F;Tornado inspired and Revel is Scala&#x2F;Play inspired. beego is closer to idiomatic Go than revel, i&#x27;m not expert but feel their MVC based structure might not be &quot;congruent&quot; to Go&#x27;s interface&#x2F;composition construct. Sorry I can&#x27;t really explain what I meant, maybe Im just anti everything Rails like MVC for web framework.<p>Many Gophers prefer to use light libraries such as Gorilla to assemble their web apps, as Go already has basic http covered in standard library. Having said that it is good idea in Go land to have a recommended template&#x2F;structure based on these light libraries for a best-practice web app that covers standard web components that are outside of standard libraries such as session, context, user auth etc. This is to make it quick to assemble an web app with all essential, and a common code structure that makes maintenance easy -&gt; the advantages of a framework. Or maybe we do need to use a web &quot;framework&quot; for Go after all. Similar reasoning on why people are using Symphony&#x2F;Laravel for PHP now.<p>Go is highly recommended for coding server backend components, the processing and brain of app. But should one use Go for web front end? Go web libraries&#x2F;framework (beego&#x2F;revel included) is not as matured as Rails&#x2F;Django, so you do need alot more of your own coding for a complete web ui front. Let me break down:<p>* If you&#x27;re are more business oriented and would like your web app up as fast as possible, use Rails&#x2F;Django. I would still use Rails&#x2F;Django even if your web app is only Rest API for a Angular&#x2F;Ember app. You can then use Go to optimise your backend.<p>* If you would like to brush up your resume, by all means dip into Go for web app. As I predict it will help you 2&#x2F;3 years down the road. I just noticed that irc #go-nuts has more members than ruby&#x2F;rails. But then so is #haskell and yet Haskell is not as mainstream as PHP&#x2F;Python&#x2F;Ruby&#x2F;Java.<p>* If you are already Rails&#x2F;Django expert and am choosing between NodeJS and Go: keep on choosing as there is no clear advantage of one over the other. And you should also consider Clojure or even Scala. OK about Node vs Go for web app: NodeJS&#x2F;ExpressJS has has more than a year advantage thus you see more NodeJS&#x2F;ExpressJS projects. I think both are on par for time-to-market if you&#x27;re developing a REST API.<p>* If you are novice programmer and new to web app, learn something like Rails&#x2F;Django for web best practices. However because Go web library is close to metal, you will understand in greater detail on how web&#x2F;http actually works by coding a web app and reading Go standard http library. You might heard that Rails&#x2F;Django is passé and you might not want to waste time for something with &quot;no future&quot;. But don&#x27;t. Those are someone else opinion and Rails&#x2F;Django will be around for many years to come. In fact Rails&#x2F;Django is the top choice of many programmers who want to leave PHP&#x2F;Java web. It is quite difficult nowadays to be a one language programmer. So pick up as main one that is current mainstream web technology (PHP, Rails&#x2F;Ruby, Python&#x2F;Django) and bet on one for future that is not as mainstream (Go, Clojure, Scala). It is harder for new programmer to pick up newer tech as far as learning materials go.<p>* If you are a superstar programmer, yes you do need to pick up Go, in addition to Haskell, Clojure, Scala, Erlang, Fortran, Basic and ARM assembly. Please do not learn go if you&#x27;re a Javascript programmer who wears a Javascript t-shirt and has a Javascript soft toy (whatever) in your bed.<p>My 2.5 cents.

One does not at all need to actually study the whole of the set.mm database (i.e. all the theorems and proofs) to implement the snap to makes sense I propose above. It simultaneously gets rid of the expensive labeling for correct vs incorrect proofs on one hand, and is a path to self-explaining AI on the other.

These changes will continue to challenge our assumptions about what are the &quot;proper&quot; paradigms, languages, and architectures for computer programs.<p>We&#x27;ve made great progress already. I can think of myself as an example: in 2005 I, like most of the programmers here, read Herb Sutter&#x27;s essay <i>The Free Lunch Is Over</i>[1] and realized that he was correct: the era of easy speedups was giving way to the era of concurrency. And programmers were going to have to figure out how to take advantage of that concurrency or an app in 2013 was going to run at about the same speed as an app in 2005.<p>But I had <i>no idea</i> how we were going to do that. I&#x27;d used threads and mutexes and locks in my professional work so I knew that correct concurrency was hard (and correctness almost never survived past a few rounds of maintenance).

than I am to write the equivalent imperative loop. I&#x27;m no genius, so I consider it remarkable that I&#x27;ve been able to digest these concepts as fast as I did.<p>And I am willing to bet that many other programmers here feel the same way.

,,"This is a rehash of a previous post of mine regarding electricity consumption:<p>Back in the days where all our electricity came from fossil fuels, I completely agree that marginal electricity usage was bad for the environment. However I think that thought has persisted with us even though it is no longer true 100% of the time. With renewables sometimes the marginal cost of electricity to our environment is near 0 or even negative (eg, during periods of higher winds and lower demand.)<p>I predict that in the future as bitcoin mining becomes more and more of an efficiency game that you will see bitcoin mining be kind of a load balancer the grid, effectively turning off during peak demand (or low supply) times and contributing to the base load during regular times.<p>For example, it may even help the economics of building new wind plants. Eg, currently it may not be profitable to build a new wind plant because base load is too low that the excess power generated would need to be sold off at 0 or even negative prices. However if bitcoin mining could be turned on during these times and off during periods of high demand, there will need to be fewer peaker plants in operation and it would positively affect the economics of opening a new wind plant.<p>Bitcoin mining only cares about the cost of electricity at a given time, it is not like most other electricity demands that are very time based. With the large variance of electricity generation by renewables, I think bitcoin can in the future help smooth demand according to the real supply&#x2F;demand curve.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like a different implementation of the Tesla utility grid batteries. Instead of deploying power, you force the grid to build more renewable capacity (that the miners are paying for) that you use except in peak periods, where you turn off and effectively provide the grid with more power.<p>Edit: here is an article of a bitcoin mining company doing just that:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-09-01&#x2F;bitcoin-miner-is-scoring-700-profits-selling-energy-to-grid"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-09-01&#x2F;bitcoin-m...</a>

,,"&gt; There is this extreme, and I would argue unscientific bias towards treating the mind as something that&#x27;s recreatable in a digital system probably because it enables this science-fiction speculation and dreams of immortality of people living in the cloud.<p>I would argue differently: perhaps your point of view that&#x27;s unscientific (or at least I don&#x27;t see any scientific path to concluding mind emulation is impossible!).<p>Say there are complex processes going inside each neuronal cell. It should not be impossible to simulate those as well with arbitrary fidelity.<p>I think what is practically questionable is <i>mind uploading</i> -- we don&#x27;t know if reading all this information is feasible, and it should be even more remote that reading it non-destructively would be possible. If it is feasible, then there&#x27;s the question of cost.<p>I don&#x27;t see why with a large enough computer we couldn&#x27;t emulate a mind (or any other existing system). It is possible a quantum computer may be necessary, but there&#x27;s still little evidence of entangled processes in the brain (indeed we strongly expect no large-scale entanglement due to high temperatures).<p>I think it&#x27;s quite radical, and difficult to understand, the possibility of mind emulation and its impact in our society. The rights of the individuals, all the possibilities like making copies, backups, modifications, pausing a simulation, running an emulated mind faster than real minds, expanding memory, and much more. This goes all completely outside usual human experience (live out your consciousness, with occasional pauses in sleep and sedation, until you die and it stops). I predict it&#x27;ll take very long until we come to gripes with all consequences of it.<p>It should be noted almost certainly Agent-AGI (AGI that acts like a person) will come before trying to emulate exactly a human mind. AGI has its own very interesting ethical questions. I think the main point we need to start taking in is that those beings will be conscious like us, thus we need to give them rights, take care with their experience, make sure they aren&#x27;t exploited (by say simulating many AGI-individuals in terrible conditions). Again there is much outside of human experience, because they will have much more freedom. An AGI doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to feel pain. Any real system might be able to override pain signals if convenient (something we can&#x27;t do); but still, if it has motivators, I think it will be able to &quot;suffer&quot; (when things it cares about go bad).<p>One of the ways we will tackle this questions is through fiction. It&#x27;s been ongoing, from what I know at least since William Gibson&#x27;s Neuromancer there have been simulated minds (and robots existed long before, although they are not always treated as equals, or the possibility of different cognitive natures is explored).",,gnramires,,1599010337,2020-09-02T01:32:17Z,comment,24349146,24345320,,,

Even the arguments were exactly the same as today - for consumers it was ease of use, no viruses/mallware and a better return on investment, while for developers it was the lack of piracy, promotion and a piece of a large pie where the competition was controlled.<p>And it's a pretty sad fact that this is precisely what Apple and now Microsoft are trying - the consolification of the PC. Well I for one do not think that consumers will buy into it. And I predict that Windows 8 will only have moderate success, while Windows 9 will be a total failure, just like Win Me and Windows Vista before it.",,bad_user,,1348810211,2012-09-28T05:30:11Z,comment,4584427,4584299,,,

,,"That is not an attractive option relative to e.g. being an affiliate of the company and getting 10% of the sales price (or much more) for no up-front investment and no sales work.  They're not necessarily competitive options vis-a-vis a single company, but if you offered terms like that, I predict no savvy person taking you up on them.<p>A more viable approach to generating cash early in the life of a company is to pre-sell a particular product which is either time-bounded or feature-bounded in return for a largish sum of cash paid up-front.  For example, Joyent used to be a fairly attractive option for Rails hosting, and they had a shared server offering where you could buy a lifetime membership on a particular tier for a few hundred dollars.  Selling ~6 of those memberships buys you the physical machine to host many more than 6 of them, meaning they raised enough capital to buy machines (or demonstrate creditworthiness to Dell) to have available inventory for more traditional hosting plans.<p>Slicehost similarly had a massive cash flow crunch at one point which was preventing them from buying hardware to service new customers for their VPS offering, back when VPSes were quite new and Slicehost was heads-and-tails the best game around.  They had an amusing auction-like mechanic: they sorted their waitlist by the dollar value you were willing to pre-pay, so if (for example) you wanted the $20 a month VPS but were willing to pre-pay for the first 6 months, you got in earlier than someone willing to prepay 3 months or desiring month-to-month.  This essentially let Slicehost borrow e.g. Bingo Card Creator's credit cards to buy new servers from Dell, without ever needing to offer any sort of equity or do anything very tricky with accounting.  (Book $1,000 of cash as assets and $1,000 of unearned revenue as liabilities, spend $1,000 cash from assets and add $1,000 of servers to assets, gradually debit unearned revenue as I consume services every month.)<p>Another example is Spreedly, which sold a particular plan for their SaaS service (I think they called them ""Kickstarters"", actually?) where you'd essentially pre-pay for 2 years of service and in return get service for life.  It apparently worked out pretty well, though your accountant will hate you if you do that.  A more typical example is a SaaS company offering you 10% off the monthly rate if you sign up for yearly billing and 15% off if you sign up for bi-yearly billing, which in both cases will tend to have the SaaS company get a whole bunch of cash upfront.  (And the same accounting thing as Slicehost, above.)",,patio11,,1343283950,2012-07-26T06:25:50Z,comment,4294700,4294604,,,

But, it&#x27;s hard to be big in every side, without running in a browser being backed by a giant like Google (but Opal <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;opalrb.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;opalrb.org&#x2F;</a> can help with that.. and I think that <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zach-capalbo&#x2F;flammarion"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zach-capalbo&#x2F;flammarion</a> should deserve more attention).<p>To address those missing features in the meantime I&#x27;ve taught myself C#, which feels comfortable and solid.

And &quot;developer happiness&quot;, is not as the author writes just &quot;The idea that a developer should just kick back, relax and things will happen magically for them&quot;.

,,"gofmt — the official formatter of the Go language — made a very wise choice for its formatting strategy. I think it&#x27;s something other tools can learn from.<p>gofmt will fix indentation, spacing, and so on, but it will generally preserve structure. For example, this:<p><pre><code>  a:=Foo{value:42}
</code></pre>
becomes, of course:<p><pre><code>  a := Foo{value: 42}
</code></pre>
But! This:<p><pre><code>  a:=Foo{
  value:42,
  }
</code></pre>
becomes:<p><pre><code>  a := Foo{
    value: 42,
  }
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s because gofmt can&#x27;t really pretend to know that it knows better than the developer here. Sometimes code does need to be loose (like in a DSL or a big declaration, or a test (which must be readable), or similar). Sometimes it should be compact.<p>This means you <i>never have to fight gofmt</i>. Never once have I disagreed with its decisions.<p>gofmt works this way because its ruleset isn&#x27;t exhaustive; it says that, yes, an indent must happen after a hanging &quot;{&quot;, but the ruleset doesn&#x27;t say that a <i>line break</i> must happen. If there&#x27;s a line break, let&#x27;s stick with it.<p>Prettier seems to have a strict normalization approach: AST goes in, canonical form goes out. For example, I tried this fictional piece of code:<p><pre><code>    performAction({
      type: &quot;thing&quot;,
      value: 42,
      owner: user, 
      bucket: root,
      path: p
    });
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s turned into a much less readable blob because it happens to fit on a single line:<p><pre><code>    performAction({type: &quot;thing&quot;, value: 42, owner: user, bucket: root, path: p});
</code></pre>
Unfortunately, in every instance where I indent the code in this manner, it&#x27;s for a specific reason. I <i>wanted</i> it on separate lines; the fact that it happens to <i>fit</i> on a single line doesn&#x27;t matter at all. Prettier overruled my carefully indented code.<p>I often format code in a specific way for <i>regularity</i>: Every chunk in a block should have the same format, because each chunk is an instance of the same pattern. For example, I might have something like:<p><pre><code>  const RULES = [
    {
      type: &quot;boost&quot;,
      fn: node =&gt; increaseImportance(node),
      weight: 0.5,
      dependencies: [&quot;priority&quot;, &quot;rotation&quot;]
    },
    {
      type: &quot;eliminate&quot;,
      fn: node =&gt; nil
    },
    &#x2F;&#x2F; ... lots of rules ...
  ]
</code></pre>
Prettier&#x27;s output generates inconsistency:<p><pre><code>    const RULES = [
      {
        type: &quot;boost&quot;,
        fn: node =&gt; increaseImportance(node),
        weight: 0.5,
        dependencies: [&quot;priority&quot;, &quot;rotation&quot;]
      },
      {type: &quot;eliminate&quot;, fn: node =&gt; nil}
    ];
</code></pre>
To quote the immortal Trump: No way!<p>Maybe one could use some advanced heuristics to find an optimal balance between width vs. indentation vs. compactness; for example, in the above array, a clever formatter could see that it&#x27;s an array of object literals, which means that it should prioritize regularity over compactness. If it&#x27;s an array of something simple (like numbers, but not numbers with trailing comments), it can go compact. Maybe.<p>I don&#x27;t use Prettier at the moment, but I know the strictness would drive me nuts. I predict that Prettier is going to cause a lot of frustration and heated discussion as a result of the one-size-fits-all approach. I don&#x27;t think a canonical form for everything even makes sense; people need <i>regularity</i> (and no surprises), but not at the cost of readability.",,lobster_johnson,,1484112852,2017-01-11T05:34:12Z,comment,13371999,13365470,,,

,,"Lifestyle inflation is very sneaky. I grew up fairly poor (and felt it), like trailer trash in a back-woods area known for potsmoking hicks poor, and now that I'm a ""starving college student"" with a decent PT job I feel pretty rich most of the time. I don't have the nicest apartment and I've parked my car for the year because the bus is cheaper and (usually) good enough. But even though I'm still not even middle class, I've noticed lifestyle inflation so I'm actively working to combat it. (Especially since I predict my income probably going up as I graduate and go FT year-round, I want the good habits now.)<p>Firstly I try to be frugal. Some people think this means cutting coupons for everything and not spending any money on fun things, but really it just means not spending money on things you don't care about, so that you can spend money on things you do care about instead. The exact categories there are different for everyone and will change over time and as your situation/environment changes. For me, I chose to give up the car so I could have more wiggle room wrt general spending money (eating out, coffee), and could afford a new laptop and glasses. Other people will bring their own lunches and coffee so they can afford a vacation, or cut down on buying electronics so they can live in a nicer place. Sometimes I fail at frugality -- recently I've spent a lot of money on videogames that I don't really enjoy and won't play much, when I already have unplayed ones and games with lots of leftover replay value. So for the next month, I'm not spending any money on videogames, and after that I'll try to think more carefully about whether I'll <i>enjoy</i> a game and whether I actually have a small enough pile of games to get around to it soon, rather than whether I can <i>afford</i> the game. Because for any individual game, the answer to that question is always YES, so it's not a helpful question to ask myself. You mentioned you drive nice carS -- does this mean you own/lease more than one at once? You can only drive one at a time, so unless you have a family with seriously incompatible schedules or are a hardcore car aficionado, that might be something you could ""afford"" rather than something you truly need/want.<p>Secondly I try not to own too much stuff, especially stuff I don't use. Owning stuff costs time and money, but we don't always see that because the costs are hidden and sprinkled around all over the place. If you're using your big house mostly to store a big bunch of stuff you've accumulated, you are paying your hard-earned money to heat your own personal junkyard. When you move house, you pay to move the junk. When the junk breaks you pay to fix it or to replace it -- because by keeping it you've already convinced yourself you ""need"" it, even if it's something you never/rarely use or whose function could easily be replaced by some other tool you have. So I try to purge the things I own regularly, keeping only the things I use and want. I did a big purge last summer and I'll probably do another one this spring. It can be hard, especially if you've been raised to believe that owning stuff is a good thing, or that ""you'll never know when you need it"", but it feels really good when you're done. This doesn't mean I live in a minimalist apartment with no stuff, of course. It just means I have a somewhat-smaller, carefully-curated collection of stuff -- stuff I'm consciously willing to actually heat and move and repair and replace.<p>Sorry if getting money advice from a poor college student seems insulting/silly. It probably is at least a bit silly, but it seems like you and I (and lots of others) have the same problem on different scales, so the things that help me might help you, if you want.",,mitcheme,,1294774778,2011-01-11T19:39:38Z,comment,2093131,2092021,,,

,,"That&#x27;s a good question and it&#x27;s not clear. As someone mentioned, here &quot;chance&quot; includes both uncertainty (facts that we don&#x27;t know), and randomness of nature (things that will happen in the future that cannot be deterministically deduced from the state of the world today). Depending on your philosophy these may overlap. Next, someone mentioned Bayesian vs frequentist.<p>The frequentist interpretation is roughly that if I go around making my best possible predictions, and we lump together all the things that I predict at 10%, about 1 in 10 of those things happen and the rest don&#x27;t. But I wouldn&#x27;t be able to be more specific about which ones in that group are more likely than others.<p>The Bayesian interpretation is that I can really view the world as flipping coins -- I don&#x27;t care whether it&#x27;s due to my lack of knowledge or &quot;true&quot; randomness -- and as far as I can tell, the coin flip involved here is 1 in 10.<p>We can also use a gambling interpretation. Here&#x27;s one based on security of python&#x27;s random module. Imagine the following three lotteries I offer you. In lottery A, you get $100 if Trump is elected. In lottery B, you get $100 if the following python code returns true on my laptop:<p><pre><code>    random.random() &lt;= 0.09999
</code></pre>
In lottery C, you get $100 if this code returns true:<p><pre><code>    random.random() &lt;= 0.10001
</code></pre>
If you would rather have lottery A than B, and you&#x27;d rather have C than A, then in some sense that you believe Trump has a 1 in 10 chance.<p>Now there&#x27;s an interesting extra layer to all of this because it&#x27;s a model predicting, not a person. In a short space, I would basically say that we&#x27;ve trained models to predict in ways that are not inconsistent with any of the interpretations above, when put into situations where that is testable.

People on YT watch the stream, have a laugh, and then don&#x27;t buy the actual product because it&#x27;s only shocking&#x2F;funny a few times before it gets old. Arguably you&#x27;re paying for the experience of a gag gift rather than the actual product. Should the manufacturer be able to demand the videos be taken down?<p>You could do this all day with products which sell themselves on an experience. You could have a streamer buy expensive clothes, wear them with a secret camera and record the (or produce) reactions they get from a first person perspective. After you watch the video, why buy the clothes since you&#x27;ve lived vicariously through them?<p>How about food shows, guy goes to diners, drive-ins, or maybe some dives, interviews the chef, orders their specialty and then films their reaction. Is he not literally making money on someone else&#x27;s work by this reasoning?

,,"-------- 2 of 2 --------<p>Assuming you see the reasoning in this deliberately &amp; comically simplified scenario above, now you just have to scale it up to an infinite number of characteristics.  And that is how I arrive at Sanders &gt; Trump &gt; Biden. The difficult-to-fathom details within my version of this &quot;scaling up&quot; will likely still still leave you scratching your head, but if you can now see my methodology, at least we can productively move on to discussing those next (the &quot;what Biden has ever done that&#x27;s worse than what Trump does all the time&quot; type of questions).<p>Now, I can easily presume a number of flaws you may want to point out in this methodology, but trust me, I am already aware - not of <i>all</i> that you would list of course, but well enough to know that there is no shortage of opportunities for miscalculations.  I&#x27;ll list just two:<p>1. All of my scores are based on my opinion, and my opinion could be 100% wrong.<p>2. I may completely lack knowledge of the existence of, <i>or importance of</i>, numerous characteristics.<p>However, if you think about it, while these complaints are both objectively true and perfectly valid, they are also somewhat orthogonal to our conversation (in a sense - TBD).  While my specific, unique methodology (the set of characteristics and scores I use in my personal model) may in fact be incredibly flawed, <i>this is the hand nature has dealt us</i>.  So, we can choose to address this problem head on (play the hand your dealt), or we can pretend that it doesn&#x27;t exist (fold, and just hope everything works out).<p>I hope this description has helped move the ball forward, if only a little.  Like, you may still not understand where I&#x27;m coming from exactly, but you should now have a half-decent idea about the vehicle I&#x27;m traveling in.  What <i>fuel</i> the vehicle runs on remains a mystery (your outstanding questions), but if this attempt at describing my thinking works, those should resolve fairly quickly.<p>That&#x27;s all I have time for now (still have work to do today unfortunately), but I would also like to leave a few YouTube videos (totally optional, but indispensable if you want to understand in detail). The intended purpose is to help deepen your understanding, as well as check if we have similar backgrounds in a domain that I consider to be incredibly important.  But first I would also like to make a prediction: based on your impression that <i>my true motive</i> in this conversation is trolling you, or arguing in bad faith, due to my <i>apparent</i> sea-lioning behavior (to be fair, it does fit the description quite nicely), I predict there is a decent chance your spider senses will now pick up on another nefarious behavior, similar to sea-lioning:  <i>gaslighting</i>.  I point this out proactively in hopes that it lowers your suspicion that I&#x27;m a complete moron, and also that I may be arguing in good faith after all.  To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re somehow not allowed to continue <i>suspecting</i> me of gaslighting, or sea-lioning, but I want to kind of &quot;explicitly set that notion on the table so we are both explicitly aware of it&quot; while we talk, which from an (ideal) implementation perspective, means something like: I should strive to be ever mindful of trying my very hardest to choose my words with utmost care, and in turn you should steelman my words to the best of your ability. (This last one I believe is actually in the HN guidelines I think?)<p>I may have added some of these already elsewhere, maybe even in a prior comment to you, I&#x27;m too lazy to check right now.  I encourage you to watch them because there are some important ideas contained within, the kind of ideas that are sorely lacking in the world imho.

IPredict: Speed of light actually exceeded by 2015,,"Okay all you theoretical zealots, save your anger and your rage for someone else. You won't get my goat on this one.<p>It's widely accepted that c0, the speed of light in a vacuum, which has a refractive index of 1.0, is  299,792,458 meters per second (1).<p>The speed of light is widely seen as finite and the upper limit of any movement of anything with a positive rest mass. Most texts state with absolute conviction (something that is supposed to be unattainable in science) that even in experiments where the speed of light is exceeded, since the group velocity of the wave carries no information (wait, what?) it's not really occurring.<p>Science also assumes that a vacuum is the ultimate medium through which light can travel, which is why the speed of light (aka c0) is always quoted as measured in a vacuum.<p>I predict that by the end of 2015, subject to the end of the world later this year, experiments in superconductivity will show that light passing through a superconductive field having a refractive index of less than 1 will result in light exceeding c0, until that light encounters another field with a refractive index of 1 or more.<p>I also predict that we won't know what the hell to do with this, since CPU processing and memory access can't currently handle information at even c0 speeds, and passing information across the superconductive substrate at a refractive index of 0.9999999999 will cause a backlog of information at the CPU or memory controller, negating the benefit.<p>Nonetheless, the speed of light will be broken, causing either (a) the opening of scientific minds and the cessation of arbitrary unproven limits to fit mathematical models or, most likely, (b) the redirection and application of millions of man hours of the greatest minds in science to disprove this finding in order to preserve the status quo.<p>What say you?<p>References :

We finally were getting serious about semantic html. Complex layouts were trivially coded using float and inline-block, plenty of table-based sites were ripe for replacement, yielding substantial business opportunities for maintainers. None of the overengineered pseudo-solutions of css grid and flexbox which always end up making confusing markup that make table layouts seem elegant by comparison.

I also very much dislike this trend of writing inline-styles. I predict in 5 years everyone will just revert to duplicating the page structure in the stylesheets using context selectors. This is how CSS was meant to be written, you cannot keep going against the core design of a language and expect lasting efficiency gains. The Cascade Is Your Friend.<p>Thirdly:
We were still reeling from the financial crash the U.S. government had created, but webdev was almost unaffected. In fact everyone&#x27;s nanny and her grand-uncle needed a page. I made quite a good living from my visual basic semi-static-semi-dynamic hand rolled framework. I wish I had learned PHP earlier, I could have made even more. C&#x27;est la vie.<p>In the end I predict the web will collapse at some point in the coming decades due to the sheer amount of feature creep in modern browsers. That deal was probably sealed the moment webassembly was introduced. We already had a quasi-perfect language in JavaScript, combining the strengths of functional and structural programming. To me it&#x27;s obvious people will continue to add features year-over-year, leading to more and more bugs and exploits. Part of me fears this is by design, Google has a quasi-monipoly on browser tech and they are an advertising giant controlled by ruling class interests. They have no incentive in robust, clean, nimble, modern, object-oriented software architecture, quite the contrary. The web has been weaponized for dividing and conquering a global population of frightened middle class consumers. And history has shown large middle classes never last.",,foraged_t,,1640023223,2021-12-20T18:00:23Z,comment,29627743,29622770,,,

,,"43 here.  You might think you still want to be coding into your 50s, but I am here to warn you that the matter is highly subjective.  I&#x27;m noticing that each subsequent job search after 40 is a little tougher and rejections are for silly reasons now (because you&#x27;re old isn&#x27;t ever one of them).  The laws won&#x27;t protect you, so forget about that.<p>No matter what you think, you won&#x27;t be as employable in your 40s and 50s as you were in your 20s--being young in the tech industry means you can be exploited and exploitation is the #1 factor.  They know young people will work a ton of extra hours for no extra pay to gain experience, to try and prove themselves, or whatever.<p>I recently talked to a colleague who is 62 and still coding.  He is worried about the next seven years as he is not ready to retire (not financially ready, that is).  His department is going through downsizing and he is trying to position himself in another area that isn&#x27;t likely to drop people.  He rightly realizes that finding a new developer job at 62 will be next to impossible.  It&#x27;s all a big chess game after 40 so be prepared.<p>Unlike the codist, I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t want to be doing this work after 50.  I have a plan for getting out. This year, because of a family obligation, I took some months off.  During that time, I did a trial run of how to &#x27;retire&#x27; from software development.  There were quite a few surprises for me and it didn&#x27;t look like I had expected.  Finding an alternative career after 20+ years as a developer is do-able:  There are roles that require attention to detail and analytical skills, but that don&#x27;t require coding, for example.<p>I won&#x27;t go into detail, but I will say I rejected downshifting to a non-developer role even though I had a couple offers at 80-90% of what I was pulling down as a developer.  Instead, I&#x27;m headed back to doing development for another 5-7 years, but with more knowledge about how to proceed in later years.  I want to retire around age 50 and am working on having the passive income to do so.  I may need to work part-time in odd jobs as well, but I predict I won&#x27;t be a developer in my 50s.<p>If you&#x27;re older, you had better understand that the next downturn could very likely take your job and getting another one will be hard.  For all the happy talk about how great the job market is and how age doesn&#x27;t matter, I beg to differ.  That &quot;great&quot; can change insanely quickly.  There is more competition in our field than ever before and the only thing that creates job security for us is being able to actually write code and get crap done and even that is of thin value because companies don&#x27;t care: they see us as another commodity.  To management, it doesn&#x27;t hardly matter how good a coder you are, companies are happy to accept fungible, mediocre people as long as the systems sort of work.<p>The last thing I will leave you with is that you don&#x27;t know how long you&#x27;re going to live.  If you have any ambition to do anything in life besides work, you need to get going on those plans right now.

,,"Putin is isolated from reality in a number of ways (I&#x27;m not claiming any mental illness, more likely the problem is that he&#x27;s been rewarding yay-sayers in a way that prevented him to fully grasp Russia&#x27;s situation).<p>1) His premise that Russia has some recognized right to exercise power over their &quot;Sphere of influence&quot; that includes other souvereign nations. While some poeple, even outside Russia, can agree to that, most of those who matter don&#x27;t, including China. Even though some may not appreciate that more countries have been joining nato, the right of each nation to make their own decisions about their alliences is seen by most as a higher priority principle.
2) His assertion that the regime in Ukraine is not legitimate after 2013. In 2014, some weight could be given to that argument, but today, it is clear that the population in Ukraine generally recognizes their government. Claiming that it is illegitimate, is similar to naming the ROC the legitimate government in China.
3) Related to (2), the belief that the population of Ukraine would welcome Russian forces as they entered their territories were clearly ill-informed. In reality, Ukraine has been fighting with all the conviction and unity you can expect from a country that values its independence.
4) Putin&#x27;s apparent belief that his military was strong and capable was similarly mistaken. On paper, Russian forces should be able to overwhelm Ukraine in days or weeeks, based on numbers of troops and materiel. In reality, the organization, morale and logistics&#x2F;planning of the invasion force was horribly 
bad.
5) Related to (1): Putin&#x27;s apparent expectation that Nato would remain completely passive was partly wrong. European nations reacted immediately with shock at the invasion, with military budgets almost instantly give increases that in total was multiple times larger than Russia&#x27;s total military budget. Also, instead of acting as a deterrent, Putin&#x27;s aggression has shown neutral neighbours that they need to be members of Nato if they want safety. (Like Finland in Sweden, who used to be very happty to stay neutral). For countries already members of Nato, Russia&#x27;s aggression also meant that many trading partners realized the danger of being dependent on Russia for strategic resources, particularily oil and gas. If most of the EU is able to become independent of such trade, that will be a huge economic loss for Russia.
6) Related to (3) and (5), the fact that Ukraine was able and willing to defend themselves so valiantly, led to weapon deliveries to Ukraine that I don&#x27;t think Putin expected.<p>So in sum, a series of misjudgments by Putin (based on, I think, not receiving realistic information about military and political matters), is now leading Russia into potentially a catastrophic worsening of their situation, both economically, politically and in terms of national security. If they maintain their current trajectory, I anticipate either loss or a very drawn-out conflict in Ukraine with no clear &quot;winner&quot;. I predict that Russia will end up isolated from the west, and become in effect a puppet of China.<p>If so, I&#x27;m not sure to what extent India will want to maintain their relatively good relations to Russia either, as India&#x27;s main competitor (I think) may no longer be the West, but rather China.",,trashtester,,1653836513,2022-05-29T15:01:53Z,comment,31549660,31536091,,,

The water erosion on the sphynx, as well as the change in flow of the Nile away from some of thier earlier cities, backs up their claim.

Not possible therefore the science must be wrong... but what if its the other way around?<p>Plato describes Atlantis in great detail, which was passed down to him from his elders.  We actually know of a site that matches his description exactly in Mauritania, deep in the Sahara, which would have been an island 12 thousand years ago when seas were higher.  It has all the exact dimensions he described correct and geography correct, has the same stone color as he described their buildings, has the springs on the central island, is beyond the straits of Gibraltar, and has plenty of artifacts strewn everywhere, yet we still dismiss it as a tall tale and no one will dig there:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Richat_Structure"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Richat_Structure</a><p>You don&#x27;t have to be a conspiracy theorist to take this stuff seriously.

At first I thought this was due to ham-handedness at MS, but nowadays I wonder if it isn't the actual strategy - the pattern has repeated so many times now, perhaps it's because it actually works for MS. Notice how aggressive advertising on Vista's behalf only began last year as W7 was going into beta.<p>Thus, I predict that Windows 8 will require a minimum of 2 cores, 16gb of RAM and a 1gb Graphics card, leverage virtualization technology for application switching and be decried as a hugely inefficient and pointless attempt to recycle server solutions onto the desktop for no good reason.

,,"&gt; In order for signal to compete in the 21st century with messaging apps around the world they need a payment story.<p>No, it does not.<p>There are two distinct groups of people using Signal. None of these groups needs MobileCoin-based payments.<p>Group one is probably the biggest and consists of &quot;normal&quot; users which use Signal because it&#x27;s the free messenger that is NOT affiliated to Facebook and has a good reputation with regard to privacy and data protection. There&#x27;s another messenger with similarly good reputation, Threema, but that one costs money, hence Signal is the more popular choice. These users may indeed find a simple payment solution through their messenger a useful feature, but they want to send each other &quot;money&quot;, not &quot;MobileCoins&quot;. Those are not interchangeable for this kind of user; they expect to send whatever is their local currency, USD or EUR or whatever, and they expect the entirety of the money they send to arrive at the target - having 20% crypto market swings within minutes eradicate 20% of their share of last week&#x27;s restaurant check while they&#x27;re transferring it to their friend is a non-starter for this group. So are exchange fees for USD-MOB&#x2F;EUR-MOB exchanges before and after sending money, even if the exchange execution itself may be automatically run in the background. This is true especially since there are already well-known and established solutions out there specifically targeting this particular need - PayPal Friends and the Cash App for example. Sure, it would be nice to have messenger integration, but if the only way to get that is to transact in MOB instead of USD and always send 10% more value than you intend to pay just to ensure the receiver gets &quot;enough&quot;, the established out-of-band solutions which don&#x27;t have those problems will simply be used. Also, this group doesn&#x27;t really have strict anonymity requirements, because they usually send money (and messages) to people they know in real life as well. Whether your awesome crypto coin is more anonymous than PayPal thus doesn&#x27;t matter at all for these guys.<p>Group two consists of those that actually depend on Signal&#x27;s security, privacy and anonymity features because they need exactly that in a messenger. Think whistleblowers, journalists, people doing stuff that&#x27;s illegal where they live. A lot of these want to send information to their contacts, not monetary value, and don&#x27;t have any use for a payment option in a messenger. And even those that do want to transfer monetary value won&#x27;t exactly be enticed by a one-click crypto transfer feature in their secure messenger, since they can be assumed to be technically competent enough to utilize the already-existing cryptocurrencies (especially those with a much longer history of privacy protection, such as Monero) and crypto exchanges to perform whatever monetary exchange they want to do. I would even say that these people would explicitly NOT want to use a messenger-integrated cryptocurrency, because that limits them in their choice of cryptocurrency and fiat on&#x2F;off-ramps, which are crucial decisions to be made carefully if you want to preserve your anonymity. And the entire idea that these guys would switch from Signal to WeChat just because &quot;WeChat has a money sending function&quot; is blatantly absurd.<p>I do not see any sufficiently large group of people that might get any value out of this MobileCoin-Signal-integration feature. Hence I predict this feature to ultimately fail due to lack of user interest. But that will only become clear AFTER a lot of good-will from tech- and privacy-minded people has been burnt by this unnecessary stunt, as can be seen for example here in the HN comments.",,Slartie,,1617821630,2021-04-07T18:53:50Z,comment,26729290,26726246,,,

,,"OK, I looked.  Here&#x27;s my response.  Call it &quot;Against Against DNSSEC, and For DNSSEC&quot;.<p>&gt; DNSSEC is Unnecessary<p>Quite the contrary.  If nothing else, it&#x27;s the only technology we have with proof of non-existence.  That&#x27;s very valuable.<p>&gt; DNSSEC is a Government-Controlled PKI<p>If you use QName minimization then it&#x27;s really hard for the government to abuse those keys: they&#x27;ll get caught unless they MITM you all the time, and to do that they need to know exactly who to MITM all the time.  It was always important to use QName minimization anyways -- essential, I&#x27;d say.<p>Also, anyone can run their own roots, and you can bet that other governments (e.g., Russia&#x27;s) have plans to run their own if need be.<p>WebPKI is no-PKI.  Whether it&#x27;s WebPKI or real-PKI, CAs can be subverted by the governments that have jurisdictions over them.  CT is not yet clearly a good enough answer (it&#x27;s post-hoc, for one), but if it is then guess what: CT would also work for DNSSEC.<p>I.e., everything is &quot;government-controlled&quot;, and no technology beats the rubber hose.  Thus &quot;DNSSEC is government-controlled PKI&quot; is grossly misinformed in the best case, or willful FUD in the worst case.<p>&gt; Had DNSSEC been deployed 5 years ago, Muammar Gaddafi would have controlled BIT.LY’s TLS keys.<p>As if the U.S. could not get ICANN to change the .ly delegation if it came to it.<p>&gt; DNSSEC is Cryptographically Weak<p>DNSSEC supports new algorithms.<p>&gt; No cryptosystem created in 2015 would share DNSSEC’s design.<p>WebPKI has the same problems because... PKI has this problem... because many protocols have this problem, that you have to support old algorithms for a while.  TLS has this problem too.<p>BTW, PKCS#1.5 is especially bad for encryption, but not so much for signatures.  See <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptosense.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;why-pkcs1v1-5-signature-should-also-be-put-out-of-our-misery&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptosense.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;why-pkcs1v1-5-signature-should-...</a> which argues that PKCS#1.5 should be replaced for signatures, but clearly the situation for signatures is infinitely less bad than for encryption.<p>&gt; DNSSEC is Expensive To Adopt<p>&gt; [DNSSEC] adds two new failure cases: the requestor could be (but probably isn’t) under attack, or everything is fine with the name except that its configuration has expired.<p>TLS (WebPKI) has that too.  Also, just because a zone is signed doesn&#x27;t mean that an application making queries against it needs to validate signatures -- you can have DNS-using apps that are DNSSEC-oblivious.  DNSSEC doesn&#x27;t make using DNS worse in apps where validating DNSSEC signatures is not useful.  DNSSEC <i>enables</i> new &#x2F; improved applications however.<p>And... DANE for SMTP adoption, and Viktor&#x27;s yeoman&#x27;s work on that are making it less expensive to adopt and run DNSSEC by causing more effort to be put into making it effortless.<p>By poo-pooing DNSSEC you might cause some people to shy away and thus you are part of the reason DNSSEC is hard to adopt.<p>&gt; A lot of code will need to be rewritten to make DNSSEC workable.<p>No, a lot of code will need to be modified to take <i>advantage</i> of DNSSEC.  That&#x27;s a huge difference.<p>Yes, browsers don&#x27;t bother with DNSSEC.  That&#x27;s fine.  Eventually they might (I predict will).<p>&gt; DNSSEC is Expensive To Deploy<p>See above.<p>&gt; DNSSEC is Unsafe
&gt; ...
&gt; But DNSSEC is designed for offline signers; it doesn’t encrypt on the fly.<p>First off, you meant sign, not encrypt.  Secondly, that&#x27;s flat out wrong.  A number of large providers sign records on the fly.  PowerDNS supports it.  It&#x27;s not hard.  In fact, it&#x27;s easier than offline signing.<p>Which makes this:<p>&gt; Authenticated denial. Offline signers. Secret hostnames. Pick two.<p>wrong.<p>&gt; DNSSEC is Architecturally Unsound<p>This section is so wrong I don&#x27;t know where to start.  You essentially <i>imply</i> that end-to-end security shouldn&#x27;t rely on trusted third-parties:<p>&gt; A casual look at the last 20 years of security history backs this up: effective security is almost invariably application-level and receives no real support from the network itself.<p>Oh?  So no WebPKI either then.  No DNS for that matter.  Or routers.  Just IP-over-pigeons, I guess.  (I can snark too.  It&#x27;s not very nice though.  I&#x27;m starting to snark because the &quot;Against DNSSEC&quot; arguments are so trivially bad.)<p>Finally we come to the crux:<p>&gt; DNSSEC doesn’t have to happen. Don’t support it.<p>All I see is that <i>you</i> don&#x27;t want it to happen, so you take advantage of your abrasive personality and sheepish people to spread ill-founded, snarky FUD against it.<p>You don&#x27;t even address the arguments <i>for</i> DNSSEC.  You just attack [with dull blades].  One would think that addressing the arguments for DNSSEC would be part of the argument against it -- it would be the polite and professional thing to do.  I&#x27;m prepared for DNSSEC not to be the answer, but I&#x27;m not prepared to accept your say-so on the basis of &quot;Against DNSSEC&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s funny though, you don&#x27;t make the one argument against DNSSEC that for a long time has been most well-founded: the DDoS threat from response magnification.  Fortunately the Internet is moving to DoH and DoT, which means using TCP, which means making the DDoS problem go away.  Also DNS cookies are getting more support.  Also, modern pre-post-quantum signature algorithms have smaller signatures anyways, which further makes DNSSEC less useful for DDoS.<p>I&#x27;m <i>not</i> saying there&#x27;s no DDoS issue, just that it&#x27;s getting mitigated or fixed, and it&#x27;s not even an argument you made in Against DNSSEC.<p>In conclusion: &quot;Against DNSSEC&quot; is wrong and weak tea.<p>&quot;For DNSSEC&quot; certainly needs to be stated though.  I don&#x27;t want to just tear down your article.  Briefly:<p><pre><code>  - DNSSEC is the *only* properly name-
    constrained PKI we have;
  - DNSSEC does provide usable security
    against misbehaved zones (CAs) when
    resolvers apply QName minimization
    (see above);
  - CT could be applied to DNSSEC if QName
    minimization were insufficient;
  - no certificate tax (fortunately Let&#x27;s
    Encrypt has made that less of an
    issue anyways, but still, see points
    about name constraints);
  - DNSSEC enables DANE;
  - DANE enables better and somewhat more
    optimized authentication because of a)
    happening in DNS, b) having authenticated
    denial of existence.
</code></pre>
Note that we could build a different properly name-constrained PKI out of DNS but without DNSSEC: just make all the registries&#x2F;registrars CAs and have their trust anchors be name-constrained even if the certificates they issue still can&#x27;t be name-constrained for whatever reason.  This would be good, really good, if we have to stick to PKIX (which I don&#x27;t mind), but it wouldn&#x27;t be as good as DNSSEC due to the lack of authenticated denial of existence.  Note that you&#x27;d still need to use QName minimization because you probably would (correctly) worry about government (and other) subversion of CAs, and you should want to use QName minimization to make it harder for any would-be MITM to decide when to get in the middle.",,cryptonector,,1586751397,2020-04-13T04:16:37Z,comment,22853134,22852450,,,

,,"I don't think Kurzweil ignores economics at all.  In fact, many of his arguments are largely based on economics, such as the cost to obtain a given amount of computation.  It is undeniable that this has gone down steadily with time.  Computation is so cheap that cloud computing (e.g., E2C, Azure) allows individual developers access to more computing than most know what to do with.<p>Your example of the MacBook Air is invalid because the MacBook Air of today isn't priced principally on performance -- it is priced mostly by build quality and performance/watt/kilogram.  Never before have computers had a better performance/watt/kilogram profile.  You have to consider the whole package.<p>The argument that there is less need for performance is also flawed.  It is not that humans have less need for computation, it's that the distribution of computation is changing.  As mentioned before, a lot of computation is moving to the cloud.  In many cases, this is simply the most efficient place for it to be; instead of having an abundance of computation sitting mostly unused on a laptop or desktop, computation is becoming a service where it is used on demand.  Think of the computation required for cloud services like speech to text processing or Google Goggles.  Most of the computation is farmed out the servers in cloud and only minimal.<p>I'm not even sure I agree that the decrease in local computational needs is a long term trend.  For one thing, migration to the cloud can only continue as long as network bandwidth keeps up with cloud data demands.  If network bandwidth is not able to keep up then I predict we'll see local computational needs spike again.<p>Even with some computation siphoned off to the cloud, AI will create a whole new class of applications for even local computation because it is so data intensive.  When the next crop of AI applications emerge and become more common, the early algorithms will probably be inefficient, which will itself cause a spike in computational needs.  The applications are here yet but there are many (including myself) that are working hard to change that.",,hexagonc,,1319133767,2011-10-20T18:02:47Z,comment,3136001,3135705,,,

Right now, people don’t seem to care about privacy all that much, and I can't blame them.

  - The platform (gmail or facebook) is a trusted third party.
</code></pre>
This is not the debate I want to be having. I don't agree with the second assumption. Any “privacy policy” I can fill out for my data will not prevent the company from accessing my data. They own the database and the file servers and even have authority over my login credentials for that website.<p>What about the privacy in the following paradigm:<p><pre><code>   - The attacker can be any person or company on the internet.
   - Your server is a VM in a distributed platform of hosts.
   - You have a special credential (id-rsa), which is used to change settings on the VM.  
   - Host can be trusted most of the time, but sometimes (prob=0.2) they are malicious.

The true spatio-temporal efficiency is probably middling except when considered in parallel for huge order throughput requirements and a large number of SKUs because an untrained primate can pick faster than a bot for arbitrary items in most cases.

VFR traffic maintains separation by &quot;see and be seen&quot;. In other words, you look out the window for nearby traffic.

,,"Thinking that Damore&#x27;s supporters seem more rational because they aren&#x27;t demanding someone be fired is circular reasoning, because it assumes that firing Damore is the less rational&#x2F;irrational course of action.<p>&gt; Because their statements indicate that, here is what Sundar Pichai wrote: “To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK.”<p>There, that&#x27;s an argument that is substantial and non-circular. The person who has the ultimate executive power on hiring and firing asserted something in his public reasoning for firing Damore, and that assertion was wrong.<p>But this still doesn&#x27;t mean that the CEO is irrational or failed to read the memo. People are allowed to make judgments based on the core assertions of a document, and they&#x27;re allowed to &quot;read between the lines&quot;, i.e. use logic and reasoning to see what is inferred beyond what is explicit. To use a historical example, back when people were up in arms about the PATRIOT Act, did everyone who oppose it also read all 132-pages of the legislation [0], or watch the debate on C-SPAN and give fair hearing to the bill&#x27;s sponsors?<p>When opponents claimed that the PATRIOT Act was anti-American, like when the EFF claimed the PATRIOT Act would give the FBI a &quot;&#x27;blank check&#x27; to violate the communications privacy of countless innocent Americans&quot; [1], were opponents being overly hysterical, given that the bill does not even contain the words &quot;blank check&quot;, nor is there any assertion that the bill seeks to scale back 4th Amendment protections. And believing the PATRIOT Act would undermine American principles is on its face <i>absurd</i>, given that its official name is: &quot;Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001&quot;<p><i>&quot;Uniting and Strengthening America&quot;</i><p>Of course not, these explicit requirements are just as absurd as believing that &quot;I&#x27;m not racist, some of my best friends are white!&quot; is a conclusive rebuttal against accusations of being racist against white people.<p>People can believe, based on all the arguments that Damore made in his memo, that he is in fact opposes diversity efforts, even if he literally states &quot;I value diversity and inclusion&quot;. People can argue that Damore has insinuated that Google has hired inferior employees in their flawed pursuit of diversity, given that Damore literally stated these things:<p><i>1. Only facts and reason can shed light on these biases, but when it comes to diversity and inclusion, Google’s left bias has created a politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence. This silence removes any checks against encroaching extremist and authoritarian policies.</i><p><i>2. Google has created several discriminatory practices: Programs...for people with a certain gender or race. A high priority queue and special treatment for &#x27;diversity&#x27; candidates. Hiring practices which can effectively lower the bar for &quot;diversity candidates&quot; by decreasing the false negative rate</i><p><i>3. We have extensive government and Google programs, fields of study, and legal and social norms to protect women, but when a man complains about a gender issue issue affecting men, he’s labelled as a misogynist and a whiner. Nearly every difference between men and women is interpreted as a form of women’s oppression. As with many things in life, gender differences are often a case of “grass being greener on the other side”; unfortunately, taxpayer and Google money is being spent to water only one side of the lawn.</i><p>Here&#x27;s a rational interpretation of those statements:<p>1. Google&#x27;s left-wing bias has prioritized diversity to the point that no one is willing to speak up against policies that are extremist and authoritarian.<p>2. Google&#x27;s hiring initiatives effectively discriminate on the basis of gender. And the special treatment for women (&quot;diversity&quot; candidates) lowers the bar for their hiring.<p>3. It&#x27;s not just hiring but retention too, as Google exclusively bends over backwards to accommodate and coddle women. But if gender-related complaints are raised by men, they are ignored (here again, Damore&#x27;s assertion would mean that Google has imposed practices and policies that directly violate federal law).<p>Maybe Google&#x27;s CEO, and maybe a few of Google&#x27;s women, see these two arguments:<p>1. Science does not support the viability of a M&#x2F;F ratio in engineering because there are naturally fewer women then men for whom engineering is desirable.<p>2. But Google, with its left-wing bias, is so desperate to find women engineers that its current hiring and retention practices are not only discriminatory (in the illegal sense), but Google has lowered the bar when considering &quot;diversity&quot; candidates.<p>-- and then they logically conclude that Damore is implying the high probability that some of Google&#x27;s current women engineers are not as qualified as they should be, as a result for Google&#x27;s irrational and unrealistic diversity quota, which, because it is unrealistic, required Google to give special treatment and lower the bar for women candidates.<p>I guess it&#x27;s possible that Damore actually believes what he asserts but that, miraculously, despite of Google&#x27;s fucked up quest, all of the women who Google ended up hiring are actually perfectly qualified, and no men were discriminated in the process.<p>But that seems like the less rational interpretation.<p>And not to be a pedant, but if you want to dismiss Pichai&#x27;s interpretation as &quot;irrational&quot; because Damore&#x27;s memo literally does not &quot;suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited.&quot; Then what do you think of Damore -- who asserts that women&#x27;s preferences&#x2F;tendencies, such as neuroticism and people-not-object preferences, are not social constructs but biological traits &quot;universal across human cultures&quot; -- and then links to the following study as evidence?<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;wol1&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;j.1751-9004.2010.00320.x&#x2F;abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;wol1&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;j.1751-9004....</a><p>It&#x27;s a metastudy Richard A. Lippa of 6 studies; when aggregating the results of these studies, Lippa states that &quot;gender differences in interests appear to be consistent across cultures and over time, a finding that suggests possible biologic influences&quot;. But Lippa argues in his conclusion that current research is limited, that &quot;more cross-cultural research is needed&quot;, and when researchers improve their predictive models, they might find &quot;messy&quot; results:<p>&gt; <i>e.g., results that show both biologic and social–environmental factors contributing to gender differences, to varying degrees for different traits, and varying kinds of interactions between biologic and social–environmental factors. Indeed, I will go on the record here. I predict that such ‘messiness’ will reign in future research on gender differences in personality and interests. If my prediction proves true, we should not be dismayed. Rather, we should simply say, ‘Such is life.’</i><p>This assessment of the current state of research is reduced by Damore to: &quot;On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways. These differences aren&#x27;t just socially constructed because: They&#x27;re universal across human cultures. They often have clear biological causes and links to prenatal testosterone&quot;<p>If Damore is allowed that much latitude in interpretation scientific research, I don&#x27;t think we can say that Pichai&#x27;s latitude in interpreting Damore&#x27;s memo as unreasonable.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;107&#x2F;plaws&#x2F;publ56&#x2F;PLAW-107publ56.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;107&#x2F;plaws&#x2F;publ56&#x2F;PLAW-107publ56.pdf</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20060605152308&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;patriot&#x2F;sunset&#x2F;206.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20060605152308&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.o...</a>",,danso,,1502439760,2017-08-11T08:22:40Z,comment,14987645,14986993,,,

,,"&gt;Won&#x27;t the others just replace 4chan in user share?<p>Due to its position as the nexus of &quot;internet culture&quot; for at least a few years in the late 2000s, 4chan is very special. It is one of two major general purpose chans (the other being 8chan). All other chans, including 8chan, define themselves along the lines of &quot;4chan but...&quot;, &quot;4chan without...&quot;, &quot;4chan with...&quot;, or similar. And if they don&#x27;t now, they started that way.<p>8chan is the only one that has gained and kept a large enough dedicated userbase for significant content and memes with broad appeal to originate from there. This is a unique consequence of its origin.<p>Most living alt chans are specialized supplements to 4chan (the &quot;4chan with...&quot; category), and make no apologies for it. Many 4chan regulars frequent one or two: I enjoy cyberpunk literature and content, there&#x27;s a chan for that. Some people hate the lack of a board dedicated to drugs, there&#x27;s a chan for that. But most still go to 4chan, at least nostalgically, often in search of a long-gone &quot;board culture&quot; that we loved years ago. And 4chan remains the single point where chan culture blends, posting style is standardized, and memes catch fire.<p>8chan was not born as a supplement to 4chan. Like many failed chans, it was created when 4chan moderators did, or were perceived to be doing or planning, something to anger users. But 8chan and the controversy that popularized it were different. Usually moot&#x27;s missteps become jokes. GamerGate convinced a significant number of people (more precisely, a subset of white male teenagers, henceforth &quot;gators&quot;) that there really was a vast conspiracy to indoctrinate the youth using video games. 4chan&#x27;s moderators were judged to be part of the media element of that conspiracy. From that point, 4chan permanently lost the trust and loyalty of gators. They went to 8chan, closely followed by far-right goons who take &#x2F;pol&#x2F; very seriously and would become inconsolable when moot did routine pranks like background music or wacky CSS. Somehow this was a diverse enough group (in interests, not background) to put 8chan in direct competition with 4chan.<p>If 4chan folds, I predict 8chan alone will get the bulk of the users unless a direct spiritual successor emerges. Board closures probably wouldn&#x27;t matter to users, neither would ads or upload limits. It&#x27;s more a question of whether those measures would actually solve the money problem.",,resfirestar,,1475613782,2016-10-04T20:43:02Z,comment,12639296,12636233,,,

,,"This is a good analysis of how Apple might implement a Siri API. I have some points I&#x27;d like to add too, based on my own (cursory) research into this topic.<p>First of all, I feel confident that whatever API Apple exposes will probably resemble one of the existing APIs we&#x27;ve seen before, such as:<p>- Window&#x2F;Kinect&#x27;s Speech API[1]- I have no experience with this one, but one of my friends used it a few years ago and described it as &quot;loading grammars for Kinect to use in parsing speech&quot;.
- The HTML5 Web Speech API[2] - I prefer the version exposed by Annyang.js[3] which is geared towards creating &quot;event handlers&quot; that fire when a certain command is spoken. The Web Speech API gives you no access to how the audio is parsed into words, however the implementation in Chrome is actually pretty awesome at detecting proper nouns, place names and the like.
- The Alexa Skills Kit[4] - This example is interesting because Alexa is essentially an &quot;OS-level&quot; assistant who has to support all the services that have been registered to Amazon.<p>I&#x27;d also like to point out some of Apple&#x27;s philosophy (as well as some of their already completed work on Siri) and how it might influence a Siri API:<p>- Starting in iOS 8, Apple gave Developers the ability to create &quot;extensions&quot;. &quot;Siri Abilities&quot; would probably be manifest as an extension, and would follow the lead of existing extensions in terms of limitations. This means users would have to opt-in to your app&#x27;s Siri abilities, and the option will not be super obvious to them unless they wanted to look for it.
- In an interview on John Gruber&#x27;s The Talk Show[5], Eddy Cue talked about how Siri for TvOS has to be able to distinguish when Spanish speakers are throwing an English movie title into the middle of a sentence. My guess is that their speech parsing logic is super complicated, and they won&#x27;t give 3rd party developers a hook into it.
- Apple doesn&#x27;t like to build things that require tons of configuration. They probably won&#x27;t give users the ability to configure which app should answer &quot;Send a message to mom&quot;. This would mean having a screen that listed every command Siri supports. Even if it only listed the commands that had &quot;conflicts&quot;, listing out all of Siri&#x27;s abilities to anyone (even just developers in a piece of documentation) is something Apple will never do.
- Apple&#x27;s gotten better about this over the years, but they still tend to make choices that privilege their apps over 3rd party apps (even if it&#x27;s just a side effect of a bigger policy).<p>So where does that leave us? I think Apple&#x27;s Siri API will most closely resemble the Alexa Skills Kit.<p>Developers will have to register a &quot;namespace&quot; for their app. The &quot;namespace registry&quot; will be like the URL protocols mentioned in TFA. Developers will to scramble to register their name, as it&#x27;ll be what users have to say to indicator which service Siri should use to fulfill the request. Once inside a namespace, developers would have total freedom to write any commands they want.<p>In the end, I predict that Siri commands (if used with the wake word) will sound like this: &quot;[Hey Siri], tell [WhatsApp] to send a message to [Mom] that says [I&#x27;ll be home for Thanksgiving].&quot; Not the &quot;Tea, Earl Grey, Hot&quot;-est thing in the world, but still really useful! (And this would be feature parity with Amazon Echo)<p>If Apple sees the above command as too awkward or cumbersome, I predict that they will not release a Siri API. I can&#x27;t imagine them releasing an API that gives developers more control. I do think TFA is right though about &quot;Voice Search in Apps&quot; being a possible halfway point.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;msdn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;library&#x2F;jj131034.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;msdn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;library&#x2F;jj131034.aspx</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;intl&#x2F;en&#x2F;chrome&#x2F;demos&#x2F;speech.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;intl&#x2F;en&#x2F;chrome&#x2F;demos&#x2F;speech.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.talater.com&#x2F;annyang&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.talater.com&#x2F;annyang&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;amzn&#x2F;alexa-skills-kit-js"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;amzn&#x2F;alexa-skills-kit-js</a><p>[5] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;daringfireball.net&#x2F;thetalkshow&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;12&#x2F;ep-146"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;daringfireball.net&#x2F;thetalkshow&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;12&#x2F;ep-146</a>",,Uehreka,,1457742072,2016-03-12T00:21:12Z,comment,11270589,11265833,,,

To the point of being synonymous with &quot;The Internet&quot; in a number of places. But they&#x27;ve had a nagging problem. People in these economies consume contents, but do not buy. Even when they have some buying power, access to credit cards is harder to come by.

Also, due to their buying impotence they&#x27;re almost <i>immune</i> to advertisement. Over the next few months it&#x27;s all going to change.

Basically turning them overnight into consumers, ripe for the picking.<p>I foresee big media producing companies in the developed world to be the first to take advantage of this (Disney, Valve, Netflix, YouTube, NYT, various online courses and certifications, etc).

But what you did, and what the coffee-drinking co-founder reportedly did (from EJ's perspective), make a very strong case for the importance of a competent PR person.<p>Quite simply, that competent PR person is the overseer of what has been said so far by the company, by the plaintiff, by the lawyers, and by the media. He or she, ideally, when queried by any of these parties, will answer such queries honestly with what he knows has been previously stated and/or promised by the other party, or will say ""I don't know that, let me ask [x,y,z] and I will get back to you.""<p>I understand how that's not a good enough decisive answer for anyone here, but that's the limits of human communication when dozens of stakeholders are involved. Some things are delayed because due diligence <i>requires</i> it...such is the complexity of life.<p>So who knows what really went on in the mind of the co-founder when he asked EJ to coffee. But according to her, we might assume that he himself assumed that EJ was properly comforted enough to send her a get-down-to-business email. She apparently was not. How could such a drastic misunderstanding happen when a co-founder, in your perfect world, is ostensibly the end-all point of proper decision and action?<p>To compound the problem, Brian Chesky writes the prototypical PR statement that looks downright shady in retrospect after EJ swiftly responds with a dramatic blog post that also accuses someone at airbnb of attempting to silence her blog.<p>Let's give Chesky the benefit of the doubt that he didn't know or condone such a request. Well, some well-intended white (from the investors' perspective) or black (from many other people's perspective) knight from airbnb apparently did so.<p>On top of all of that, EJ accuses airbnb of cold shouldering her until the blog blowup at HN. Hell, I don't remember the exact timeline, but I doubt even most of the avid participants in this thread do...certainly none of the newcomers won't bother sketching out a flowchart for themselves.<p>Boy, having one competent person be the sole point of contact -- even just a smooth-talking PR underling --  sure sounds good right now. Even if we give the co-founders the benefit of the doubt of being as upfront and willing to help as possible, the apparent innocent miscommunications have made many people, including MA, very jaded.<p>And now you've thrown yourself into the mix, in the belief that this is all caused by the immature incompetent behavior of the airbnb executive team (boy, that's a great message to future airbnb investors) and failed PR...don't you think it's a wee bit ironic to make your ""I-tracked-her-down-and-gave-her-info-to-PG-because-I-can't-see-PG-screwing-this-up"" comment in a HN thread based on a TechCrunch post in which a self-professed fan of airbnb accuses PG of outright lying?<p>If providing fodder for another top-voted HN thread that accuses airbnb of a coverup isn't a screw-up, then, well...<p>In any case, you might be a well-intentioned, smart developer and entrepreneur.

Once those two factors are solved (and a build-up of lithium mines is key to that) electric cars will go from being a niche within a niche to utterly dominating the market very, very quickly.<p>Within the next decade we might see companies like Hyundai&#x2F;Kia, Toyota and Honda selling more EVs than ICE. Take the Kia Niro EV as an example: if the cost of batteries halved and the supply was unconstrained, there is little stopping that kind of product from dominating the market—starting with two-car households with off-street parking.<p>With their lithium cell investments, Telsa are well positioned to benefit from this boom, but they need to think carefully about their positioning. Right now they&#x27;re a luxury brand with no serious competitors; when Telsa&#x27;s drivetrain advantage is substantially neutralised, their mind share is likely to stagnate.<p>In my opinion Tesla needs to prepare to be in the budget space.

The Internet has a history of overreactive paranoia when it comes to change.<p>Example #1: I remember a huge privacy backlash when the first social networking site opened.

I suspect Google has reengineered Android to allow for modular system-level updates, while leaving user-space modifications, (such as carrier and manufacturer-added software,) untouched, similar to how Canonical has stated Ubuntu Touch updates will work.<p>We&#x27;ve already seen Google take a more modular approach to adding Android enhancements via individual application updates to the Play Store, GMail, YouTube, etc. This has allowed users running older versions of Android to take advantage of more up-to-date software, despite the lack of manufacturer-provided updates. Given the degree to which the Play Store service can modify the OS in the current version of Android, it seems reasonable to suspect that these modular updates could be extended to include the kernel, system services, and low-level run times.

I&#x27;m not Asian, but the majority of my friends, classmates, and coworkers throughout my life have been, and that continues even now during my career in tech.<p>Whenever I see anything related to affirmative action being discussed nowadays, I think that it&#x27;s only a matter of time until Asian women are treated the same way as Asian men. Once you&#x27;ve managed to close the gender gap in engineering, you have a new problem to deal with -- a lack of diversity among women engineers in regards to race and socio-economic class. A continued pursuit of diversity will require discrimination similar to that exhibited by prestigious American universities.<p>My coworkers (past and former) and friends who are women SWEs overwhelmingly fall into two buckets: American-born Chinese with parents who are middle-class or higher, and PRC-born Chinese with wealthy parents.<p>I get the strong impression that gender diversity is viewed as more important than race and class. I&#x27;m a male of color who has been in the industry for more than four years now, so I no longer have to worry about breaking in. If I were applying to CS programs or looking for my first job right now, I would feel some resentment. I&#x27;ve convinced and helped three of my friends to do a career switch because there&#x27;s just so much assistance (financial, educational, and otherwise) available for women. From what I&#x27;ve seen, there is just so much more provided to help women get into the field.<p>I commend the big tech companies for lumping male URMs and all women together when it comes to prioritization, but this isn&#x27;t the case for most companies, who are expending great effort on balancing the gender ratio while treating men of color as second-class URMs, or even ignoring their status completely. It&#x27;s fortunate that the best jobs are the most fair, but even if a place sucks, a first SWE job is still a first SWE job.<p>What I predict will happen is the gender gap will begin to close, but the aforementioned diversity issues not related to gender will remain. This will be due to a combination of various factors, with the most significant being fatigue with affirmative action practices, and that discussing socio-economic and race is much more sensitive than discussing gender, Saying &quot;stop hiring men&quot; or &quot;only hire women&quot; is easy, even if you are asking people to discriminate against candidates similar to themselves. &quot;Stop hiring Asian women&quot; is not.

In even mild headwinds, it&#x27;s likely that only a part of the expected bonus will be paid, and not unusual for there to be none at all.  Furthermore, the bonus plan is usually determined one year at a time, so the fact that whatever needed to happen this year for everyone to be paid at 100% did happen is no guarantee that the criteria in next year&#x27;s plan will be satisfied.<p>Do not assume that the future looks exactly like the recent past.  It is certainly possible that the near future will be even <i>better</i> than the recent past, but at least some kind of mean reversion is a hell of a lot more likely.

,,"&gt; Bitcoin and Zcash are stores of value that allow users to participate in this decentralized application space without the need for fiat currencies.<p>How is Bitcoin a store of value?  An ounce of gold is a store of value - someone had to do the work of finding and mining it, and it can be used to fill teeth and conduct electricity.  Gold is portable, uniform, durable and divisible, so it is a commodity that has good currency qualities.  But almost every commodity that can be sold is a store of value - what value does Bitcoin have?<p>Bitcoin boosters scout around the world for some commodity to compare it to and fail, as it is inherently valueless and ultimately worthless, i.e. ultimately worth nothing.  So they come across the US dollar, an item whose value has a question mark over it.  So they say &quot;this is like a dollar&quot;.  Of course, one can then just say a joke cryptocoin like Dogecoin should have a market cap that is over half a billion dollars.  And it does ( <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinmarketcap.com&#x2F;currencies&#x2F;dogecoin&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinmarketcap.com&#x2F;currencies&#x2F;dogecoin&#x2F;</a> ).  Even Dogecoin&#x27;s creator says the half billion dollar market cap is all just a big joke.<p>Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t even have the portable quality of a good currency.  Bitcoin transactions have hit large transaction latency issues (or had them when I last looked into it when I did a transaction a few months ago).  So the &quot;currency&quot; isn&#x27;t even good as a currency any more.<p>US fiat currency was indirectly backed by gold until 47 years ago, and with the window then shut, it is now doubly-indirectly backed by that gold (the US did not get rid of its 8000 tons of gold at Fort Knox and other locations in 1971 when, apparently, a magic wand was waved over Treasury department printing presses, giving them the power to create value).  I won&#x27;t go into why the dollar and Bitcoin are not equivalent here (but if someone makes a coherent explanation why the US did not get rid of its 8000 tons of gold, I will).<p>At least Pets.com, subprime new housing development real estate and so forth had value at some level.  These cryptocurrencies have no value.  They are all going to crash.  I wondered for a while when and how that will happen, but now I know - things like Dogecoin and its clones will bring it down.<p>Another thing - anyone who bought Bitcoin, Ethereum or Lumen in January is currently under water.  All three currencies dipped at that time, and in fact all cryptocurrencies dipped simultaneously.  So when the (total) crash comes, I predict all cryptocurrencies will go to zero.<p>As Keynes said, markets can remain irrational longer than you or I can remain solvent.",,Ologn,,1525660713,2018-05-07T02:38:33Z,comment,17010013,17009758,,,

,,"I read this article, but I don&#x27;t believe the conclusion, because it goes against my economic understanding of demand curves.  As far as I personally believe (though I only have one economics paper, and I&#x27;m no Warren Buffeett), adding taxes to any item must decrease quantity sold, regardless of the reason for the taxes or whether consumers know about it.<p>Here is something to think about:<p>- Suppose the retail price of sugar is $1 per pound today.<p>- Let&#x27;s think about the situation where adding a sugar tax <i>didn&#x27;t</i> decrease consumption. i.e. suppose that if after a tax consumers have to buy for $1.50 per pound still they will buy just as many as if they have to buy for $1 per pound. They are just not price-conscious.<p>Isn&#x27;t that possible?  That&#x27;s what the article says! It says that consumer buy just as many cans at $1.52 as $1.40, if they don&#x27;t know about the taxes!  So maybe they just don&#x27;t care about $0.12 that much, I mean is that going to stop you from getting a drink?<p>So, we can can sort of imagine that, right?  For the $1.50 versus $1 for a pound of sugar example, if you&#x27;re going to bake a cake, will having to pay $1.50 rather than $1 for the sugar stop you?  How can we know this isn&#x27;t the case? Perhaps it really is a situation where whether it&#x27;s $1 or whether it&#x27;s $1.50 has the same number of units sold, consumers just don&#x27;t care that much, unless you mention a big scary word like &quot;taxes!!&#x27; to them.<p>So, here&#x27;s something to think about if that&#x27;s the situation:<p>-&gt; If consumers are just as happy to pay $1.50 as $1, then <i>why don&#x27;t stores sell at $1.50 today</i>?  I mean they&#x27;d sell just as many, right! They&#x27;d just get an extra free $0.50 on each one! Why don&#x27;t they do that?<p>So is it out of the goodness of their hearts? Or, do they not know their customers, are they leaving all this money on the table, have they never experimented with prices?<p>No.  They don&#x27;t sell at $1.50 <i>because they would sell fewer units</i>.  Much fewer units.  So much fewer units that even 50 cents in free profits on each and ever unit would cause them to lose more customers than the free profits are worth.  That&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t set the higher prices - because <i>there is less demand there</i>.<p>This <i>proves</i>, though a bit informally, that taxes will always decrease demand: if they didn&#x27;t, the sellers would <i>already</i> have set their price at the higher quantity even without the taxes!<p>What is a more likely explanation?<p>So, I don&#x27;t believe the conclusion of the study.  It concludes that it is mere mention of the taxes that causes some people to reduce their consumption, and otherwise their consumption remains price-inelastic.  I think a more likely explanation is that by mentioning the sugar tax, consumers are reminded that the product has sugar in it, which they know makes them fat, is bad, and is so bad that it has a special tax on it.  This reminds them to choose another product.<p>How to test this explanation:<p>They could try selling sugar drinks at the same $1.40 as non-sugar drinks, and write on it &quot;Includes SF Sugary Drink Tax&quot; in the test group and not include that notice in the control group.<p>I would do it like this:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;hXmGt9F"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;hXmGt9F</a><p>(I would subsidize the taxes for the purposes of the experiment, by reducing the retailer&#x27;s profits).  I predict that the one that mentions the sugar tax should include fewer sold than the one that doesn&#x27;t mention it - because it reminds consumers that sugar is bad, which is what I believe is the explanation for the effect observed.)<p>The bottom line is, you can be quite sure that taxes work for sure to greatly reduce the number of units sold.  If the study concludes that without mentioning the sugar tax, consumers buy just as many at $1.52 as at $1.40, then why wasn&#x27;t it sold for $1.52 before the taxes?<p>Where this breaks down:<p>As I mentioned, you have to subsidize the price to match the $1.40 on the sugary drink.  You get less profit.<p>So perhaps the price will be set at $1.50 <i>with or without</i> the tax! It&#x27;s possible that the taxes just decreases someone&#x27;s profits, without impacting consumer prices.  The prices are set at &quot;the price the market will bear&quot; and taxes just impacts the profit margin on that.<p>From this point of view, a certain level of taxes might kill a market entirely: perhaps sellers can&#x27;t change retail prices, level &#x27;A&#x27; of taxes keeps sellers&#x27; profits at x, level &#x27;B&#x27; of taxes reduces sellers&#x27; profits by 50% so that they make only 0.5<i>x of profit, level &#x27;C&#x27; of taxes reduces profits by 75% so that they make only 0.25</i>x of profit, and level &#x27;D&#x27; of profits reduces sellers profits by 99% so that they make only 0.01*x of profit.  There is also some level &#x27;F&#x27;, where sellers would have to pay to subsidize consumers, or there are 0 units sold. The sellers will stop bothering to carry the products at all.<p>At very high tax levels, the only way the market clears is illegally, by not paying that taxes.  I don&#x27;t think retail outlets will start carrying sugar while trying to illegally avoid taxes on it, like they&#x27;re some illegal drug shop, so, at those prices the stores will just drop those items from their inventory.<p>Bottom line:<p>- Taxes decrease units sold.  It is a strong and real effect that is guaranteed to exist in all cases.<p>- There is a certain level of taxes at which products would not be carried at all.<p>- Taxes may or may not impact consumers as much as sellers - the taxes may merely decrease sellers&#x27; profits.<p>Taxes on sugary products work.  You don&#x27;t need to tell consumers about them.  They affect advertising too: if the price the market will bear is $1.52 with or without taxes, but sellers get less profit on the product with high taxes, they will stop advertising it as heavily, stop promoting it, stop carrying it.  Pepsi, for its part, will put more advertising into its Max product (sugar-free), which does not have taxes eating into its market.<p>Taxes work at artificially reducing quantity sold, and consumers don&#x27;t need to know about them for them to work.  It is impossible (according to my economics understanding) for the study&#x27;s conclusion to be correct: “If you tell consumers the true cost of the tax, it is no longer effective in reducing purchases.”<p>This cannot be correct in my opinion.  In my opinion, its conclusion cannot be correct: &quot;the bottom line, he said, is that if cities want these policies to be effective at reducing consumption of unhealthy beverages, they must mandate that tags mention the added tax – but not reveal how much it is.&quot;<p>On the other hand, I do believe the finding about labels (essentially: &quot;Hey! This has sugar in it!! It&#x27;s subject to a special sugar tax!!&quot;) is interesting in itself, and should be tested separately, without a price difference being a factor.  It is an interesting and worthwhile study and I agree with its authors&#x27; point of view that reducing sugar consumption is worthwhile.",,logicallee,,1635945489,2021-11-03T13:18:09Z,comment,29094171,29093202,,,

,,"That's a toughie. Apple's had an extraordinary decade that'll be hard for them to top. I certainly think it's prepared to have another extraordinary one. But whether it'll compare to the decade of the iPod and iPhone and iMac is a bit trickier.<p>That said, I'm going to bet on them surpassing themselves. The iPad is a truly extraordinary device, and Apple will spend years and years making it more and more powerful, more accessible to the public, and easier to develop for. (At least, I <i>hope</i> that last point is true.) At the same time, they're continuing to evolve the Mac OS X to a point where it's really differentiated from Windows, and serves a different kind of purpose for different consumers. I think they might see a resurgence in laptop/desktop popularity. In fact, I'm certain their desktops will become more popular, especially with the huge screens; the laptops will get more popular <i>unless</i> they're eclipsed by some future brilliant iPad.<p>I'm also going to bet on the Apple TV seeing a lot more attention than it's received so far. I have the latest one and it's a beautiful little box. I can see them doing a lot to innovate in the world of streaming video and music. They've got the iTunes store, after all, which is still expanding. And they've shown hints in the last two years that they're looking at new innovative ways to deliver content. I know the iTunes LP hasn't seen much attention recently, but systems like that which add more content to the music we listen to have the potential to really invigorate the music world, especially if they give indie artists access to those tools.<p>It's possible that the iPhone will soon see a peak, especially if competitors finally rise to the occasion. But I predict it's still going to rise in popularity. And the iPod touch still hasn't got a decent competitor. Certainly no music player comes close. Maybe the 3DS can compete with it as a gaming platform, but the 3DS isn't attempting to be a universal device like the touch.<p>The new millennium has been kind to Apple.

,,"I really have to disagree with one aspect of this comment (&quot;the erosion of standards in the humanities.&quot;) Perhaps that&#x27;s to be expected because I&#x27;m an academic who works in the humanities. But my point is a simple one and it&#x27;s something that you can test out yourself: try comparing a half dozen academic history article written in, say, 1950, to a half dozen from 2015. I predict that, on average, a 2015 article will feature a far more robust evidence base, a broader range of sources, a richer historiography, and more rigorous language training than its counterpart from the 1940s, 50s or 60s. In my experience there is simply no comparison. In part this is because digitized texts make it so much easier to access a wide range of sources, but it also has to do with an increase in standards of graduate education. Getting a PhD in a field like history used to be an old boys club based on connections and family money. It certainly still retains some of those trappings today, but I think there can be no question that academic training today is far more rigorous (and entering graduate school or getting an article accepted more competitive) than it was in decades past.<p>I don&#x27;t really take issue with the comments about students and multiple choice exams, though.

,,"Yours is the consensus view, I&#x27;m contrarian on it. Appealing to it as being &quot;universally recognized&quot; as an argument about its validity is a logical fallacy.<p>The methodology of recent history has been to instrument everything, and then use that to analyze. I&#x27;m not ignorant, I&#x27;ve done this. It&#x27;s an effective way of not fooling yourself. However, the downsides of such data collection have, for the most part, been ignored in the process of determining what to instrument, how that data is stored, and what is to be done with it. This is an industry-scale oversight and is going to rapidly change, especially in light of new regulations.<p>Beyond the fact that such data is a liability (and usually can be de-anonymized) and the legal requirements of having it being burdensome, organizations need to ask the question of if their data collection policy is ethical. Your &quot;universal recognition&quot; in my mind is more of a &quot;universal blind spot&quot;. On the contrary, instead of saying that lack of a data collection policy is a cop-out due to laziness or lack of care, I&#x27;d argue that falling back on collecting data shows a similar kind of laziness, where you&#x27;ve failed to come up with a better solution to your problem of understanding how well your product is performing that doesn&#x27;t require violating the privacy of your customers.

The System 360 for IBM, defining it as the provider of mainframes for enterprises. MS-DOS for Microsoft, defining it as the dominant PC OS. The Macintosh for Apple, defining it as the most user-friendly consumer brand out there. GMail and Maps for Google, defining it as the conglomerate of the Internet age. Mobile for Facebook, defining it as the service that connects people regardless of where they are.<p>The second pivot happens when the company is 10-15, at the height of its dominance, and usually results from it entering the hottest new technology wave with a vengeance. It looks like it succeeds for a while, crushes early entrants, serves to legitimize that technology wave, but ultimately peters out as the company can&#x27;t keep up with the changes that it introduces. The IBM PC for IBM, which legitimized the PC market but ultimately fell to clones. Internet Explorer for Microsoft, which legitimized the Internet but ultimately was eclipsed by Google&#x27;s many products. The Newton for Apple, which legitimized the PDA market but ultimately was too early. Google+ for Google, which legitimized social networking but ultimately failed to gain traction.<p>The third pivot is when the company realizes that they basically incapable of innovating, and returns to the roots they established with the first pivot to live out their old age. Open-source consulting for IBM, leveraging their massive installed base of enterprise customers. VS Code, XBox, and Azure for Microsoft, recognizing that they are fundamentally a platforms company.

,,"The market was sabotaged plain and simple because the big fish are moving in. The result will be regulatory capture that make sure the small&#x2F;medium companies that created the market hand it over to the bigs.<p>Vaping oil is much different than vaping flower or dry. Vaping simply means non combusted smoke which since it is under 450 degrees it reduces and removes 20+ carcinogens.<p>Noone thinks smoking is purely healthy, but comparing vaping to cigarettes it is a no brainer safer. Oils probably a little less safe than dry.<p>Also, cigarette butts are next to plastics as the most environmental damage. e-cigs and vaping is mostly re-usable and there are no butts about it.<p>A decade of vaping, no issues. Suddenly lots of bunk production where the problem isn&#x27;t nicotine or THC it is people trying to stretch supply by putting in harmful filler (vitamin E oil). If you ask me that is blue ocean market sabotage. The big fish are moving in.<p>I predict the market of vaping suddenly being &quot;safe&quot; when the bigs are in. It was safe before, until it was sabotaged for the misinformation&#x2F;disinformation to create the outrage and distraction. It is almost too easy with our social tabloid outrage market now to manipulate to keep the big fish richer and richer, while people fall for the scam.<p>Prohibitions and banning does not work, makes it more unsafe and obliterates harm reduction.<p>Safe markets that are convenient and available beat black markets. But you shouldn&#x27;t help the bigs squash the small&#x2F;medium that are already testing within their states in their respective legal state limited markets. This happens at the beginning of all large new markets that are blue oceans, the shakeouts happen on the regular by the bigs.<p>The legal market here shows how it can improve these areas and find issues quickly. This was a black market sabotage move that was quickly rooted out. It has been turned into another authoritarian prohibitionist banning movement using children again. Overreaction and banning ONLY helps the big fish or the black market, makes everything more unsafe and obliterates harm reduction.<p>The big fish can weather this storm, the small&#x2F;medium that were doing it right cannot and you just side with the big fish when you do this. Nearly all prohibitionists&#x2F;authoritarian people end up doing that just like in this case.<p>Vaping is already illegal by age, no need to harm adults that have Right to Body. We need a Right to Body amendment that could have a whole political party around it, it could change the world.  It would remove all laws and illegality around owning your own body including: drugs, sex&#x2F;sex working, choice, etc for adults and legal markets that are safer.<p>Parents need to step up to stop kids from vaping under age. We don&#x27;t need the whole country or government to be Big Daddy, that is what an authoritarian system has like China or Russia.<p>Companies shouldn&#x27;t be able to market them like cigarettes or alcohol, but taking from all because of a few ends up in tyranny, even if you think that small step is harmless, it is not. Otherwise they&#x27;ll start banning video games, sodas, food, candy, coffee, etc etc.<p>You have to understand human nature, anything banned increases in value due to black market, anything legal where clear information gets out, starts to help the issue and safer production. Just like in this case, the market was legal, the problem was found to be Vitamin E Acetate quickly.<p>Think it isn&#x27;t black market or big fish sabotage? Note the time when Altria bought in Dec 2018 and note when the outrage happened, 2019, see a timeline pattern? [1] Stay tuned, they need people temporarily being against this to win this market as well, keep up the outrage for nothing and they will win.<p>&quot;But think of the kids!!&quot; Oldest trick in taking over markets disaster capitalist big fish book.<p>Will you still be saying &quot;think of the kids&quot; when they ban reddit? How about video games, sodas, food, candy, coffee, etc etc? There are plenty of prohibitionists that want to ban all of that and have tried with cases like this many times. They even tried with reddit for FOSTA-SESTA bills after the Craigslist&#x2F;Backpage classified section shut down because the bigs wanted that and it was one of those &quot;think of the kids&quot; moments that ended up being complete lies [2].<p>Prohibitions and banning never works on things people choose to do with their own bodies, it will only benefit the black market and the wealthy big fish as well as the cartels&#x2F;mafias.<p>Nearly all authoritarian prohibitionist people end up helping authoritarian and big fish in the market just like in this case.<p>Altria will benefit the most, they can take the temporary setback and it is even some false opposition going on to help this. Juul was bought into recently (2018) and the outage started months after (2019) [1]. Altria also ousted the CEO from before, now they will be able to own more of it with reduced value. This was a simple disaster capitalist big fish play and prohibitionists fell for it.<p>Prohibitionists are out here fighting for big fish killing off innovative small&#x2F;medium companies that were doing it right. If you are in the outrage state, pro-prohibitionists and own it, you are letting the big fish take the market from the small&#x2F;medium players that were doing it right, or the black market mafias&#x2F;cartels.<p>This had nothing to do with the legal market, the legal market is the only way forward with age limitations and safety testing&#x2F;regulations that don&#x27;t squash the small&#x2F;medium at this stage.<p>Just be aware, the bots and trolls are out pushing this. The President looks to be doing an Executive Order soon to limit vaping while easing up on cigarettes, just like all the Republican governors that did it. [3][4] Same play different day, big fish win, &quot;think of the children&quot; authoritarianism and big fish disaster capitalist raiding of the blue ocean that will be immense when marijuana is fully legalized and vaping is suddenly &quot;safe&quot; when the bigs run the show.<p>This is America.<p>People not thinking it is about market power and money are naive as hell.<p>You think this is for health reasons? laughable.<p>Same with all bans and prohibitions, makes it more unsafe and more lucrative for mafias&#x2F;cartels because there is decreased supply and increased demand, price goes up, in comes the underground and more danger.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;20&#x2F;678915071&#x2F;altria-buys-35-percent-stake-in-e-cigarette-maker-juul"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;20&#x2F;678915071&#x2F;altria-buys-35-perc...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;inside-backpage-vicious-battle-feds&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;inside-backpage-vicious-battle-f...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;09&#x2F;11&#x2F;health&#x2F;trump-vaping.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;09&#x2F;11&#x2F;health&#x2F;trump-vaping.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019-11-08&#x2F;senior-white-house-official-says-fda-shouldn-t-regulate-tobacco"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019-11-08&#x2F;senior-wh...</a>",,drawkbox,,1573322494,2019-11-09T18:01:34Z,comment,21493040,21491723,,,

,,"Wow. Its just so incredibly obvious that this is just MegaUpload in a new form and that the entire point is to allow sharing of copyrighted data. Kim is hanging this whole thing on plausible deniability but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what's really going on. This infuriates me. Sharing copyrighted files isn't what pisses me off. What does is the arrogance of Dotcom to try to pass this thing off like its for legit sharing of files. We have Google Drive, Dropbox, Box.net, Amazon's thing, iCloud and a billion others and no one really messes with them. There's no doubt in my mind that those services are storing some copyrighted data but they don't get messed with because they're truly legit. The feds didn't go after MegaUpload because it allowed people to share files that may or may not be copyrighted. It did so because the worst kept secret on the web was that if you want to download the new Lady Gaga single you could probably find it pretty easily on MegaUpload because that's basically what everyone was using it for. I honestly have no qualms about not backing up my claims with specific examples and evidence in this case because everyone here knows what was going on at MegaUpload and anyone trying to deny is either twisting their minds into a preztel with the mental gymnastics they'd have to do to convince them otherwise or they're just outright lying. I said it.<p>So now that they have this new approach I doubt they'll be successful. Because of the way the new Mega is set up you can't search for content. Allowing the ability to search for content would necessitate getting rid of their whole privacy scheme. I predict that the new Mega could still be used to share copyrighted files but the onus will be on third parties to keep track of such files in a database or something in order to provide links to people searching or it can just become a safe place to store your copyrighted files and share them on a case by case basis (through email, links on forums, or wherever). But if this really is supposed to be a legit service, which it isn't (come on, you know it), then I don't see how it can gain market share or mind share given the alternatives we already have had for a while now.",,bpatrianakos,,1350582973,2012-10-18T17:56:13Z,comment,4670017,4668772,,,

They&#x27;re insane to get started on, hard to maintain, hard to monitor, and at the end of the day have far worse performance for end-users.

,,"This is a subject that is very dear to me, so I will try not to rant about it.<p>There are a couple of things &quot;wrong&quot; with the way we teach kids computers today.<p>Our educators are in the hands of the masters of consumers.  When a new technology comes out, we all abandon the current stuff, and engage in the upgrade cycle.  Repeat until generations have no clue any more about what the old ways were.<p>This is an absolute falsehood pushed upon society by those who wish to control the consumer base.  It is consumption destroying education, plain and simple.<p>The point is this: Every C64 that was ever produced - heck, every 8-bit computer, ever - <i>STILL WORKS</i>, or can be <i>MADE TO WORK</i> in the area of computer education.<p>It is absolutely arbitrary that computers get old.  Every machine that was ever made, is still just as useful as it ever was - the difference is, the user walked away (because they are consumers not users).<p>I have a large collection of &#x27;antique&#x27; computers in my midst: C64, Atari, Oric, Atmos, Telestrat, MSX, heck .. even a BeBox and an SGI O2.  All are still working, all are still quite capable of engaging a young mind in the exercise of exploration and discovery that makes a good developer.<p>And, my 3 year old and 6 year old kids LOVE THEM.  They absolutely LOVE the old sprites, the old simple ways.  The 6-year old takes immense joy out of typing:<p><pre><code>    10 PING
    20 WAIT 15
    30 EXPLODE
    40 WAIT 50
    50 GOTO 10
</code></pre>
.. into an old Oric Atmos thats been set up exclusively for him to be able to do that .. in fact the very first writing he was able to do was in typing in a BASIC PROGRAM!!<p>The 3 year old absolutely loves that he can turn the machine off and on, and off and on, and off and on .. and it will still work.  Can&#x27;t do that with Daddy&#x27;s workstation!<p>So the point is, parents: disconnect your kids from the consumer trap.  Give them old computers to learn computing on.  Everything they will ever learn, <i>WILL STILL BE VALUABLE TODAY</i> when they &#x27;grow up and get a bigger computer&#x27; - the reason is, because computers still work, fundamentally, the same way.<p>I predict my 6 year old will be hacking in assembly by the time he is 10 - just like his Dad did.  And thats what made me the developer I am today.<p>(BTW: yes, I also have rPi&#x27;s, Beagleboards, and so on.. when they&#x27;re ready, they&#x27;ll be available to the kids to hack on.  But if the kids can&#x27;t do their own low-level programming by the time they get the rPi dusted off, I will be <i>very</i> surprised..)<p>EDIT: Another thing that is &#x27;wrong&#x27; with computers today, imho, is the decoupling of development from use.  Again, our computers have been turned into consumption platforms - the moment that Microsoft removed the developer tools from being part of the base OS image, computers started to lose a lot of value.  Any OS that doesn&#x27;t ship with a way of building apps for it, inherently included by design, isn&#x27;t an Operating System - its a Consumer Capture System.<p>Do everything you can to get development tools back into the OS, people.

I predict that it will eventually be considered as necessary as electricity itself. Depriving people in rural areas of that can be seen as somewhat inhumane and unfair.<p>On the other side, it seems kind of selfish to expect a company&#x2F;government&#x2F;whatever to spend billions of dollars to deploy infrastructure into areas where they will have one customer every 10 miles. This would eventually lead to increased costs for everyone, including those who have made the &quot;sacrifice&quot; of living in more densely populated areas.<p>One of the benefits of living in rural areas is that you&#x27;re away from people.

I agree though that a mixed mode can be a best of both worlds scenario.<p>If we as a whole continue down the path of more WFH, open shared office spaces may eventually begin to find their feet and fill that &#x27;mixed-mode&#x27; equivalent if the company itself does not have office space. I predict there might also be more public spaces such as libraries opening up with work areas for people to get out of home when working.<p>The other challenge is the social component of work, but I think that will change post-Covid too. Being in Australia has afforded me the extremely lucky capability of being able to get out and socialise almost completely freely during the last year, and it undoubtly helps immensely. I think that for people who live alone, working from home will become less isolating when they can socalise outside of work hours more freely again. For example, social sport is a lot easier to fit in to your day when you&#x27;re not then also losing an hour or more in your day to travel. You can do it and still easily have time to prep dinner or do your daily chores.<p>In short, I think that the shift to WFH due to covid will be a lot easier for a lot more people once the restrictions of Covid subside.",,NamTaf,,1616661499,2021-03-25T08:38:19Z,comment,26577718,26577542,,,

,,"The music industry has always been a horrible nasty beast in my eyes. In the days of radio, playing music on the radio was first seen as &quot;advertising&quot; for a new record. Record companies paid to get their music on the radio for people to hear, so they&#x27;d go out and buy a record.<p>Then people wanted to hear more music on the radio, because 1) it was free, and 2) they wanted to learn about more new music. Record companies pushed for full time music radio stations.<p>Then there was a turning in the streams... commercialization of the music radio stations. Hey, all the kids are listening to music, let&#x27;s play an ad. The music industry was still selling record (more than ever before), but oh no, people were listening to ads, and radio stations weren&#x27;t sharing that profit with the music industry!<p>The music industry starts charging royalties to radio stations for playing their music. You know, the music that served as ads to the records they were selling. As a result less and less music and more and more ads were being played on the radio.<p>Consumers began to dislike radio, and cassettes and optical discs were becoming easier to get in cars, and in portable forms. The music industry jumps on both band wagons and all but stops producing vinyl records, and makes cassettes and compact discs available for the every day Joe.<p>CD pricing surges in the late 90s as the music industry is starting to realize that they can&#x27;t keep doing things the way they always have, because CDs and cassettes are too easy to copy. As a result they head out to start making the government say it isn&#x27;t fair to copy your CD or tape and give it to a friend. It isn&#x27;t legal to copy your CD to your computer. It isn&#x27;t legal to share music track by track.<p>The music industry spends millions on stopping piracy (notably losing the war for many many many years).<p>Streamers enter the scene. Piracy all but stops. Kids are no longer downloading, and owning the music they listen to. Instead they are streaming the music, and the music companies demand royalties. Streamers introduce ads to keep the streams free to consumers. Some consumers want to pay for music, but want it on their terms. The music industry instead of helping streamers is now basically forcing them into losing money.<p>Yes, there are the big players like Google, Amazon, and Apple streaming music, and taking the loss because they are retaining customers. However, I don&#x27;t think even that can last forever.<p>I predict another rise in piracy is on the horizon. These types of shenanigans are the reason for it, but they won&#x27;t learn, they won&#x27;t change.

The others are gambling (with apes?), drugs, mindless hedonism (there&#x27;s an app for that), following cults and crazy ideologies (Qanon? flat Earth?), pointless political intrigue, and war both physical and cultural. There will be a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.<p>Starship is the most important project at this point in human history. Without a frontier there is nothing but meaningless conflict, repetition, and stagnation. We will sit here on Earth and basically masturbate until some black swan event destroys our civilization or even our entire biosphere. That event could be something stupid we do, an asteroid, a gamma ray burst, who knows... but it doesn&#x27;t matter. If we stay here intelligent life dies.<p>I think Starship is even more important than fighting climate change, since winning that battle still leaves us trapped in a cyberpunk dystopia that just happens to be a little more sustainable. That means instead of global warming trashing our civilization we might get a few more centuries of pointless masturbation before something else kills us.<p>Edit:<p>Keep in mind too how frontiers work. Novelty is imported from the frontier back to the old culture. The frontier revives everything. It&#x27;s like going for a hike in the woods or a trip to a new city, but at civilization scale. Even if only 0.001% of humanity ever goes to space, I predict a civilization-wide effect.<p>As an added bonus as far as we know there are no natives in our immediate region of space. The &quot;new world&quot; of Europe&#x27;s great age of frontier exploration was not a pure frontier, and it came with the moral baggage of war and displacement. The new frontier is pure. It&#x27;s all exploration, no conquest. It&#x27;s going to be more like the settling of the Polynesian archipelago (by the original Polynesians) than the European age of colonialism.<p>Anyway what a crazy rant from an article about VR... but I think it&#x27;s relevant.

,,"&#62; Game engines have long supported OpenGL. Mobile profiles are now more common, but if your argument is that DirectX is no longer relevant because of OpenGL -- this arguably would have happened a long time ago. Game engines were probably some of the first to support the OpenGL (even before DX and D3D became relevant).<p>Actually, no. The largest game engine of last generation was Unreal 3, which never had comprehensive and direct opengl support (I don't know how they hacked OSX in there) and supported the ps3 through the DRM library (handhelds were through GLES). The only U3 game ported to openGL was Dungeon Defenders for the recent Humble Bundle. If more games and engines were on opengl, porting to Linux would be a simple recompile a significant majority of the time, because they don't depend on win32 for the sake of the same cross platform behavior.<p>&#62; Steambox stands a chance if they do exclusives on their platform of things like HalfLife and Portal.<p>They could just be the best value proposition. I don't think people will ever stop buying Xboxes, Playstations, or Wiifus since they always have first class exclusives. I just think that if the Steambox and steam sale system works, either the other platforms will have to dramatically cut prices to compete, or they will lose out on major sales. And a big difference is that Steam games work anywhere you can install Steam, and the platform is also a value proposition.<p>&#62; Shield doesn't look particularly more inviting than the PSVita. I think the dedicated portable game device is probably dead.<p>In many ways, that is the beauty of Shield. It isn't a dedicated gaming device, it runs stock Android and has controller buttons built in. Sure, the platform isn't a great idea if you <i>aren't</i> going to game on it, but it can easily function as a general purpose tablet outside of gaming. I am certain one of the analog sticks on shield will behave like swiping for the purposes of app emulation. It would be nice for reading web pages. It also can act as a netflix machine, or any movie or audio player. PSVita doesn't have that luxury.<p>The other reason to put more faith in the Shield than Vita is that targeting Shield targets 70% of the phone market and 30% of the tablet market. It targets a platform that will continue to grow, and you release your game not as an in-store one time purchase physical flash memory card but off the Play Store and as such will be a continuous source of revenue (despite Play games selling for significantly less than console counterparts, but I imagine dedicated Android gaming platform owners will buy games).<p>&#62; Ouya -- breakout success for them would be getting 1% of the market. Which they may get. It'll be niche at best.<p>They won't even get that. The Ouya succeeds not if they move a lot of units but if games developed for Android start supporting hardware controllers. As soon as that happens, the Ouya isn't niche at all, and games that target Android and work on it just make it a positive value proposition to complement other Android devices you already have. It runs reskinned Android though, so I don't know if it as capable as a Shield as a general media device.<p>&#62; I will let you know right now what can totally change the tide in gaming... Oculus Rift (and VR headset in general). Seems easier to pull off then the MS Illumiroom and would provide a more immersive scenario. If a platform can pull this off at a reasonable price point ($99/headset max) -- I predict they win.<p>I'd like to see the OR work out too, but I think the market for VR headsets isn't that big. It is comparable to 3d tvs, albeit less gimmicky in most ways. I don't see myself going out of my way to stick on a helmet to play Doom 3. Then again, I didn't like the ideas behind motion controllers either, so I'm probably just outside that demographic.

This is a choice you can make as your circumstance dictates.  Dark mode is a nice option for a few cases, but it should not be forced upon anyone.<p>There are two cases where dark mode is a really bad thing:<p>1. You&#x27;re presenting your content via a projector in a room full of people (and a room full of people will have some ambient light, because safety rules generally prohibit trapping a lot of people in pitch darkness).  No matter how many lumens the projector can put out, they will not make your low contrast content as visible as light mode would have been.  Most often, the ambient light of the room will completely wash out the low contrast projected image.<p>2. You&#x27;re making a screen recording of your content to demo or educate others (Youtube, etc.).  The low contrast, colorful text will not compress as accurately as light mode, so the resulting text will be blurrier than if it were in light mode.

Most people don't consult the <i>New York Review of Books</i>. Most people see very few book advertisements. Even those of us who do most of their book buying online still wander through bookstores and libraries. Physical objects have a powerful draw. I buy almost all of my computer equipment online, and yet I still find myself wandering through the Apple Store, just to experience the physical presence of computers and computer users.<p>Dedicated physical bookstores are going to get even harder to keep open. They might get smaller. They might continue to diversify until they're basically cafes with books lining the walls, or small performance spaces where authors gather to hold readings, or something. But I suspect that, somehow, the biggest and most successful publishers will continue producing copies of physical books and putting them on shelf displays in places where readers are likely to gather, just to get those books in front of people's eyes at the exact moment when those people are in a book-browsing mood.<p>Then they'll sell electronic copies. Right there in the store. Barnes and Noble apparently agrees with me: They're plugging the Nook front and center in their brick-and-mortar stores.<p>Or, maybe I'm wrong.

And I would agree that programming is not the only way that one can learn the knowledge that one should have in the modern world so that one can be adequately informed on security/privacy issues and so on. But it certainly helps. Coding is becomming a less specialised job by the decade regardless of what any of us think about it. If one espouses the idea that 'programming is as important as reading' even if it may not yet be literally or globally true, then we are aiming for the stars and in the process, at least perhaps hitting a mountain.<p>No doubt your father is an acomplished man, but he would be a better Windows power user or sys admin if he was comfortable with PowerShell.

If one has a very blinkered view of the advantages that programming can provide then yeah, it's just a highly specialised tool, useful only to a few. But that's not what programming is to me. To me, its about communication, expression of ideas and discovery.<p>You say that learning JavaScript won't help you to understand your computer better. I disagree. By learning JavaScript, you will involuntarily learn more about one or more web browsers and perhaps from there, you may become more informed on how information is transmitted across the web and perhaps from there, you may learn to better protect yourself through more consistent use of encrypted data transfer, just as an example. You are right when you say learning to program does not magically impart knowledge of file systems or networking but when I learned Ruby, I would have had to try pretty damn hard not to learn by osmosis at least something I didn't know before about these topics while I was learning the language.<p>So yes, in the narrowest sense, programming is not currently as important as reading.

,,"&gt; The problem upper bounds tries to solve just does not exist in other languages because packagers are expected not to break backwards compatibility.<p>I&#x27;ll agree that Haskell moves faster and has more breaking changes, but that statement is just wrong.  Look at <a href=""http://semver.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;semver.org&#x2F;</a> (not related to Haskell at all) and you&#x27;ll see that the very first point on the page is about incompatible API changes.  So clearly this issue exists outside of Haskell and people have developed methods for managing it with version bound schemes.  You are arguing against rapidly changing software, not against upper bounds.  In your example where the Django server is not making backwards-incompatible changes, upper bounds wouldn&#x27;t hurt you at all because the bounds are on the major version number, but exploit fixes that don&#x27;t break backwards compatibility will only bump the minor version number.<p>Comparing Haskell to any other mainstream language in this discussion is invalid because the other languages have been around a lot longer and have reached a more stable state.  Python appeared in 1991.  The first Haskell standard appeared in 1998.  So that means Python has at least 7 years of stability on Haskell.  I would argue that Haskell gained adoption much more slowly because it is much less similar to any mainstream language that came before it, so the actual number should be larger.  Paul Graham&#x27;s essay &quot;The Python Paradox&quot; came out in 2004.  I would suggest that Haskell is just now getting close to the point that Python was at when PG wrote that essay.  That means that Python has at least 10 years on Haskell.  So if you&#x27;re comparing breaking changes in Haskell today with Python, you need to compare it with Python as it was 10 years ago.  If you think the breaking changes are not worth that much pain for you, then don&#x27;t use Haskell right now.  But you shouldn&#x27;t make that decision without educating yourself about the benefits the language has to offer.  For me, it is a small price to pay compared to the benefits I get from Haskell.<p>Only time will tell, but I predict that companies based solely on Haskell will emerge in a few years dominating their competition because they can write better quality software, iterate faster, with fewer people, more reuse, fewer bugs, and easier maintenance than companies not using Haskell.",,mightybyte,,1395930224,2014-03-27T14:23:44Z,comment,7480543,7479202,,,

Lower complexity: &quot;everyone is a man&quot; seemed to work back in the day.
2. Higher complexity: let&#x27;s subdivide male and female. There are certainly other genetic traits besides X and Y chromosomes that we could include in our definition of sex.

,,"&gt; Firewalls at the enterprise level are FULLY required for business to operate in a relatively secure manner today.<p>They&#x27;re also completely unsustainable, because &quot;firewall traversal&quot; will always be a thing.  The result is a tit-for-tat arms race between firewalls and applications, with application protocols being encapsulated deeper and deeper, and firewalls trying to inspect packets deeper and deeper.  The overall system complexity skyrockets, and we all know that complexity is antethetical to security.<p>I predict that within the next few years, we&#x27;ll see attackers successfully targeting vulnerabilities in firewalls and antivirus software directly.  Add BYOD to that and the entire mess will collapse in a decade or two---probably much sooner.<p>Firewalls are a temporary workaround for poor application security, nothing more.  They are pollution---they hurt everyone by turning connectivity into a hard problem.

Or going into a store and asking for some free food. [...] I asked for a number of newspapers. I asked to take the plastic flowers from a storefront. I asked to borrow board games from the board game store.

The behavior is targeting a reluctance to ask for help and favors from others when it counts (it&#x27;s important for long-term wellbeing to have a balance between taking and giving, versus just giving).

Each of them was told in their high school education, explicitly, that girls don't need to know math or logical thinking, that it was for boys.<p>One was part of a school system that graded girls on effort in math, and never given valuable teacher time or feedback or help, because ""they will go on to the humanities anyway"" and actually learning the stuff ""would waste time"" for the teachers. She is really interested in programming, and struggles with the college classes she's taking because the basic mathematical thinking was denied her. It isn't that she can't grasp it - the other day when started going over code exercises, she just needed some explaining and practice on variables because her algebra teacher didn't care to go over it with her. Her programming teacher doesn't want to ""coddle"" her. But with a bit of explanation and basic concepts review, she grasped it just fine, and deduced implications on her own. You know - getting it.<p>What the heck does this have to do with anything, blah blah unfair I predict you whining. Well, it's this -<p>If someone is denied the chance to do something, and the system she is part of is the reason for denial, then perhaps a good response is to provide the opportunity by other means. Boys aren't being denied. In fact they were explicitly getting something extra as a result of being the girls being denied.<p>So we give the girls the same thing. We don't give it to the boys, they would then be given extra, and not the same chance.  That is why this sort of thing is needed.<p>Oh, BTW all of the women I am referring to are from Illinois, some in more rural parts, some in Chicago.<p>And yes, we need to fix the system that does this to prevent future occurrences.

,,"Fair point (for the most part), but the illustration graphic shows a Nexus One... which was indeed released with 2.1 (the latest and greatest).  Not terribly material, just silly.<p>Now, on the substance: the reason why many of the phones lag behind is that the manufacturers and carriers have the ability to customize the system - sometimes to add features (multi-touch appeared in some HTC phones before the Android core), sometimes to junk-ify the phone.<p>Some of this I predict will fade, as manufacturers/carriers find the value of having the LatestAndGreatest OS will outweigh the perceived benefits of customization.  Some of it probably won't, which is the unfortunate but mostly unavoidable consequence of producing an open/open-source platform.<p>My guess is that over time Google will make a greater effort to distinguish the phones that will be kept up-to-date (because they have few OS customizations) from the ones that just use the Android OS as the basis for their own distro (this is the very fine semantic difference between ""Android"" and ""Android with Google"").  How closely consumers will distinguish the two, is of course another matter entirely.<p>Edit: As an aside, I've been surprised (though perhaps I shouldn't be) how many of my non-tech friends don't even really identify ""Android"" as a brand - when I tell people we develop for Android, I often get a blank stare - they don't realize that the Droid, Nexus One, etc. have much of anything in common.

It suggests that deep learning will expand from its present capabilities of recognizing patterns to one day master logical relations and employ a rich knowledge base of general facts, growing into a situated general problem solver that one day may equal or surpass human cognition.  Maybe.  But he then proposes that deep nets will rise to these heights of self-organization and purposefulness using one of the weakest and slowest forms of AI, namely evolutionary strategies?<p>I don&#x27;t think so.<p>The many problems bedeviling the expansion of an AI&#x27;s competence at one specific task into mastery of more general and more complex tasks are legend.  Alas neither deep nets nor genetic algorithms have shown any way to address classic AGI roadblocks like: 1) the enormity of the possible solution space when synthesizing candidate solutions, and 2) the enormous number of training examples needed to learn the multitude of common sense facts common to all problem spaces, and 3) how to translate existing specific problem solutions into novel general ones.  Wait, wait, there&#x27;s more...<p>These roadblocks are common to all forms of AI.  The prospect of replacing heuristic strategies with zero knowledge techniques (like GA trial and error) or curated knowledge bases with only example-based learning is unrealistic and infeasible.

Eg, currently it may not be profitable to build a new wind plant because base load is too low that the excess power generated would need to be sold off at 0 or even negative prices. However if bitcoin mining could be turned on during these times and off during periods of high demand, there will need to be fewer peaker plants in operation and it would positively affect the economics of opening a new wind plant.<p>Bitcoin mining only cares about the cost of electricity at a given time, it is not like most other electricity demands that are very time based. With the large variance of electricity generation by renewables, I think bitcoin can in the future help smooth demand according to the real supply&#x2F;demand curve.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like a different implementation of the Tesla utility grid batteries.

,,"This is a pretty good roundup of recent trends. Of course projecting past growth numbers to the future needs to be taken with a <i>huge</i> grain of salt; don&#x27;t try estimating solar capacity in 2035 by taking the 50% annual growth rate since 2001 and plotting the results over another 18 years.<p>There are a couple of qualitative predictions (observations?) that I didn&#x27;t see in the article that I&#x27;d like to make for posterity.<p>One observation is that increasing numbers of electric vehicles and plugin hybrid electric vehicles can actually <i>help increase</i> an electrical system&#x27;s integration of intermittent renewables. Currently, solar&#x2F;wind power become marginally less valuable as more is installed because at their peak production times they don&#x27;t find enough demand to match supply. Peak demand time in most systems occurs in the early evening when people get home from work, start using appliances, and adjust home temperature up or down depending on the region and time of year. Late night generation from high concentrations of wind power, and mid-day generation from high concentrations of solar power, go wasted and discourage further installations that will increase oversupply. But if you add charger-connected EVs with a dynamic pricing system, you can signal &quot;discount power -- charge now!&quot; to EVs whenever supply is high relative to demand. Each depleted EV can offer ~1-10 kilowatts of dispatchable demand to help match non-dispatchable supply. In terms of balancing the grid that complements the traditional method of dispatching supply to match uncontrolled demand. It also means that you probably don&#x27;t need to upgrade distribution infrastructure for a long time even as EVs become more common: late night charging with can be scheduled for hours where distribution infrastructure is traditionally under-used and the vehicle will still be charged to drive when people wake up.<p>I also predict that big infrastructure projects for long distance transmission are going to enable more and (eventually) more <i>diverse</i> energy resources to compete with fossils. For example, Texas&#x27;s big Competitive Renewable Energy Zones transmission projects started in 2005 with a legislature that was looking to bring wind power from rich Western Texas resources to Eastern Texas load centers. Solar was so expensive back then that it wasn&#x27;t really part of planning. But now that the transmission infrastructure is built and solar continues to fall in price, I expect future Western Texas solar projects to cluster around that already-built transmission capacity. Since wind output typically peaks at night and solar peaks mid-day, solar and wind production can get complementary uses out of the same infrastructure. And if storage continues to fall in price, I predict that <i>storage projects</i> too will eventually cluster around the endpoints of CREZ transmission, so they can save a little of the late-night wind peak or the mid-day solar peak and use it to serve the early evening demand peak.",,philipkglass,,1487537048,2017-02-19T20:44:08Z,comment,13681869,13680794,,,

A whole chapter is about how the Amish culture is not necessarily anti-technology so much as they are slow, disciplined adopters of technology. They hold their people&#x27;s culture above all other values including productivity or connectivity and so to them it&#x27;s a clear decision to at first be skeptical of new technologies and to deliberate the adoption of these technologies until the elders of the community can come to a consensus. Even then they usually allow small &quot;pilots&quot; or testing of the technology with a select few individuals at first. Kelly doesn&#x27;t suggest we adopt the Amish culture, simply that there is something to be learned here.<p>I think A.I would need to become a fully robust form of consciousness capable of generating its own novel ideas spontaneously and to form a sort of gestalt from a mix of information, logic, patterns but also &quot;feelings&quot; (or whatever term would be used for &quot;feelings&quot; in a conscious AI) in order to produce the same type of translation a human can. Granted, even without consciousness it will likely come extremely close over time with more training and improvements to the algorithms but as Hofstadter explains it takes more than a sort of algorithmic proficiency:<p>&quot;..To me, the word “translation” exudes a mysterious and evocative aura. It denotes a profoundly human art form that graciously carries clear ideas in Language A into clear ideas in Language B, and the bridging act not only should maintain clarity, but also should give a sense for the flavor, quirks, and idiosyncrasies of the writing style of the original author. Whenever I translate, I first read the original text carefully and internalize the ideas as clearly as I can, letting them slosh back and forth in my mind. It’s not that the words of the original are sloshing back and forth; it’s the ideas that are triggering all sorts of related ideas, creating a rich halo of related scenarios in my mind. Needless to say, most of this halo is unconscious. Only when the halo has been evoked sufficiently in my mind do I start to try to express it—to “press it out”—in the second language. I try to say in Language B what strikes me as a natural B-ish way to talk about the kinds of situations that constitute the halo of meaning in question.&quot;<p>I predict we will prematurely adopt machine-learning powered translation at the cost of loosing depth, clarity and the richness of the human expression of ideas but for the majority of us the impact may be minimal especially if great human literatures are still translated by humans.",,jamesmcintyre,,1517350509,2018-01-30T22:15:09Z,comment,16269604,16267816,,,

,,"While slightly off topic , I wrote about this subject on Reddit when someone said Android allows it and hasn’t lead to serious App Store fragmentation on that platform so I’ll just copy and paste here:<p>There’s a reason for this that I’ve been thinking about and it all comes down to Pushing Power. Android , on its own, doesn’t have a lot of “pushing” power because it’s not monotheistic. It requires all the players in the game to play nice in order to make something the norm. If Samsung or Google does something in their own, it doesn’t have the pushing power to turn the industry (only really Androids). Google could have that pushing power, but their reputation of killing and rebranding services hurt them. There aren’t assurances that they won’t kill something so there’s no backing of it. And this affects everything down to the developers of the platform.<p>How can one push anything on such a platform ? The Google play store will probably have the average consumer’s wants and there’s too much friction of installing another store for one thing. This lack of Pushability works since Android likes to churn out razor-edge and innovation features, even if these features don’t talk to each-other like iOS users often expect, and it doesn’t matter if these features are 100% baked.<p>But iPhones is a different story. It’s probably one of the most powerful pushing platform there is. Think about it. Apple was able to remove the headphone Jack and sell the solution. Neither Google nor Samsung has the pushing power to do that since their customers can just get a similar experience elsewhere. They need Apple to do the “crazy” thing first and just follow suit down the line once Apple has successfully done it. Because in the end , no matter what Apple does, there is no where else we can ever get the parity with the seamlessness that is the iPhone. And as a result it has pushing power.<p>And this extends to its Apps to. I bet Android Tablets are great (I actually own one my self but never use it). But I’m also willing to bet an artist is going to Choose the iPad every single time because in the end Android does not have Procreate nor an App that can approach the experience of procreate. Procreate, by being an Apple exclusive app , has Pushing power and if it were to move to an alternative store , users will follow. Mobile Gaming is probably the most popular gaming platform there is (crazy right) and I’m willing to bet a tenth of what whales put down that they would download a third party store if a game like Genshin Impact were to move and I’m willing to pay another tenth that they would absolutely become and Epic Games Store exclusive if they we’re offered.<p>Every one’s thinking that this will lead to more competition and better things for the consumer but that’s not how it’s going to go down. Here’s what’s going to happen:<p>If Sideloading and third party stores are permitted Epic will immediately start securing exclusive third party apps—not just games but apps to promote their store. They will pay the exact same book they play on Desktops because it’s the smartest play there is. Eventually they will get the app (I predict Spotify) that will make everyone have to download their store in order to use. They of course will also do this on Android as well but will be more successful this time since their success on iOS will go mainstream and affect android as it always does (think removing the charging brick). Other companies (I predict Google and Nintendo) will do this also and find success and the mobile device app Ecosystem will become exactly like the browser app Ecosystem (minus PWA probably).<p>TL;DR: Android is not a good indicator of what would happen if iPhones did what it does because it never is nor was. iPhones has always been the “pusher” of the mobile device industry, not in that it releases cutting-edge features first, but that it pushes what features are the norm. What happens on iPhones have a far greater impact on Android consumers than the vice versa. If you don’t believe so see: Smartphone boom (don’t matter who did it truly first but who did it truly right), removal of headphone Jack, removal of charging brick, faster adoption of NFC in US despite years of Android Phones having them, And Airtags.",,Jcowell,,1624464211,2021-06-23T16:03:31Z,comment,27606085,27603849,,,

,,"&gt; HN specifically avoids politics.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this to be argumentative, but I suspect that is once again merely your perception.  HN avoids (dang aggressively shuts down, to the detriment of the world imho, because if smart people can&#x27;t find a way to discuss these things objectively, how do we expect the average person on the street to) political discussions that have a caustic odor, but there&#x27;s <i>plenty</i> of political shit talking on HN.<p>&gt; &quot;conservative&#x2F;libertarian&quot; do you mean: fiscally conservative<p>Yes, but the real kind, not the phonies we&#x27;ve had for decades.<p>&gt; socially libertarian (Liberty as a fundamental right; if you&#x27;re not violating the rights of others the government is not obligated or even granted the right to intervene at all)<p>Yes.<p>&gt; or conservative as in imposing your particular traditional standard of moral values which you believe are particular to a particular side of the aisle<p>To a degree, but here I think you&#x27;re dealing with an interpretation of reality more than reality itself (not meant as an insult; it&#x27;s how humans are).  But yes, somewhat, and this is a whole other interesting and important conversation, that I think society should be having in a more serious &#x2F; less polarized way.<p>&gt; Or, do you mean that you&#x27;re libertarian in regards to the need and the right to regulate business and industry in the interest of consumers (&quot;laissez faire&quot;)?<p>I used to be very laissez faire, but in many specific areas I am now the exact opposite - if I was in charge, corporations would be in for a very rude awakening.  But laissez faire is my default stance until facts suggest it is excessively harmful to the greater good.<p>&gt; At issue here, I think, is whether we think we can avert future escalations of costs by banding together to address climate change now<p>100% agree.  But if we willfully ignore the realities of human nature&#x2F;psychology, I predict we&#x27;ll never be able to even remotely band together, especially in the hyper-weaponized-meme world we now find ourselves in.  Averting future escalations is the larger goal, but it is completely dependent upon cooperation, which is dependent on communication &amp; <i>perception</i>.  I believe perception is where we are failing most.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m personally and financially far more concerned about the long-term costs of climate change than a limited number of special interests who can very easily diversify and&#x2F;or divest to take advantage of the exact same opportunities.<p>Me too.<p>&gt;&gt; and I am deeply distrustful of government (for extremely good reasons I believe), so I know for a fact that my interpretation of the article is going to be heavily distorted by that. Any logical inconsistency, ambiguousness, disingenuousness, technical dishonesty, or anything else along those lines is going to get red flagged in my mind, whereas others will read it in a much more forgiving fashion. And in an article on a different political hot topic, we will switch our behaviors.<p>&gt; While governments (and militaries (TODO)) do contribute substantially to emissions and resultant climate change, I think it unnecessary to qualify that unregulated decisions by industry should be the primary focus here. Industry has done far more to cause climate change than governments (which can more efficiently provide certain services useful to all citizens)<p>I think you misunderstood.  Here I&#x27;m not talking about government&#x2F;military damage to the environment (although that&#x27;s a very big deal, <i>the hypocrisy of which reinforces my distrust even more</i>), I&#x27;m saying that I don&#x27;t trust what they&#x27;re up to <i>at all</i>.  With a few exceptions (Bernie Sanders, etc), I am very distrustful of the true honesty and sincerity of all politicians regardless of affiliation.  I suppose this is less that they&#x27;re fundamentally dishonest, but rather the nature of our system is such that you have to be dishonest.<p>&gt;&gt; In such threads, I think it would be extremely interesting for people with opposing views to post excerpts of the parts that &quot;catch your attention&quot;, with an explanation of why. This is kind of what happens anyway, but I&#x27;m thinking with a completely different motive: rather than quoting excerpts with commentary to argue your ~political side of the issue with the goal of &quot;winning the argument&quot;, take an unemotional, more abstract view of your personal cognitive processing of the article,<p>&gt; These people aren&#x27;t doing jack about the problem because they haven&#x27;t reviewed this chart: &quot;Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Time Series&quot; (1980-2019) <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncdc.noaa.gov&#x2F;billions&#x2F;time-series"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncdc.noaa.gov&#x2F;billions&#x2F;time-series</a>  Maybe they want insurance payouts, which result in higher premiums. Maybe the people who built in those locations should be paying the costs.<p>I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;ve completely misunderstood.  I was referring to a meta discussion, on human psychology and the nature of perception - the distinctly different way in which you and I <i>consume, perceive, store, integrate, and recall</i> the information in an article, not the information itself.  I believe this is where the solution to these problems is hiding.<p>&gt; They don&#x27;t even care because they refuse to accept that it&#x27;s a problem.<p>Here you are acting as if you are able to read the minds of other people.  Intuition, which is kind of a dimensional compression of perceived reality, has evolved in humans because it is extremely useful.  However, when dealing with high complexity, it can be dangerous.<p>&gt; ( I had hoped that the other top-level post I posted here would develop into a discussion, but these excerpts seem to have bubbled up. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20919368"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20919368</a> )<p>Oh, you&#x27;re not wrong on those facts I&#x27;m sure, but people don&#x27;t think in facts.  They <i>think</i> they do, but they don&#x27;t actually.  If we want to do something about these and other problems, you have to look for the invisible blockages, and some of them are within you and I, despite the sincerity of our intentions.<p>Unfortunately, even genuinely smart people (like much of the HN crowd) seem to be extremely resistant to even considering this notion.  I suspect the problem is that although a person may be highly educated, at the subconscious level they are still highly tribal.  But I believe if we can get people to start to realize these things, to see the world in this abstract form, then much of the rest might fall into place far easier than the current <i>apparent</i> polarization of beliefs would suggest.",,mistermann,,1568140266,2019-09-10T18:31:06Z,comment,20931576,20925339,,,

,,"Netflix and other high bandwidth content delivery services should have used Bittorrent from the very beginning, and now are hitting a lot of resistance from ISPs because of their stubbornness to use CDNs instead.<p>I predict that companies will not be quick to embrace technologies like these, because they are stuck with the legacy of the DMCA (and region coding) so the loss of net neutrality is inevitable.<p>I’m hopeful though that the tech community will anticipate this and come up with a metric for broadband that only measures p2p traffic.  That way when Comcast and others claim to provide a certain connection speed, it can be trivially verified and consumers can steer clear of false advertising.<p>Also the public needs to be made aware that the primary cost of internet traffic is still long distance, basically anything that has to travel out over the backbone.  The connection from your home to the ISP is a one-time cost.  So p2p traffic like Bittorrent actually lowers overall costs for everyone by sending data over the backbone just once and then distributing it from the local caches on everyone’s hard drive in the same city.  Eventually that cost will be so low as to approach free, which is why I think self-organizing meshnets and darknets are also inevitable.",,zackmorris,,1409697073,2014-09-02T22:31:13Z,comment,8260553,8258062,,,

,,"Your application is very interesting but it looks like you&#x27;re trying to do too much at once. Especially with the AI part haha. I think a subset of it is achievable by one, focused person for a limited set of students and topics. As another said, the crap people deal with today is mandated by law and policy under a regime that won&#x27;t buy into what you&#x27;re proposing. Further, many places require by law that the kids are in what educational system considers a school rather than your app. So, you might want to prove the idea by hitting the market for workforce training and personal improvement then pivot into general education as both will use similar resources.<p>Another problem with your proposal, a huge one, is that there&#x27;s nothing in it about countering spread of misinformation. Quick link to give an idea of how easy invalid information spreads and persists across social media:<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iflscience.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;facebook-echo-chambers-help-spread-and-reinforce-misinformation&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iflscience.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;facebook-echo-chambers-...</a><p>That or another Facebook study also pointed out that retractions (eg a Snopes article) only slowed misinformation in the 30-40% range IIRC. The bad info spreads more and lasts longer in your model. It has to be detected somehow with official counters on any topics where there&#x27;s a consensus that they <i>need</i> to know. That means your model, like the others, needs human beings that act as sort of teachers and moderators. This is even true for a high-quality forum of smart people like Hacker News. Alternative is some AI that knows everything about how people speak, these topics, how to explain them... artificial teachers of nearly human intelligence that nobody has built yet. Since you lack that and need humans, your model can&#x27;t scale for general population at the rate of technology scaling. Instead, it&#x27;s something like N teachers per M groups where the N to M ratio is however much stuff the teachers can follow and moderate. You then modify this somehow with the fact that specific people or groups vetted by teachers as knowing the material can be rated among the N as their input is trustworthy. Might even compensate volunteers somehow a la StackOverflow or Quora if they contribute a certain amount.<p>Far as full experience regardless of bandwidth, do look up the concept of progressive enhancement as illustrated with this project:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;19&#x2F;why-we-use-progressive-enhancement-to-build-gov-uk&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;19&#x2F;why-we-use-prog...</a><p>That thing even works on Lynx. Now, you want images, video, interactivity. The images can be compressed quite a bit while still being clear. Same with video. More compression for lower bandwidth links. Animated GIF&#x27;s done well can illustrate in a few images what otherwise takes a video. Still popular on many sites. Use straight-up <i>text</i> where you can as my old text &amp; RTF files were way smaller than Word or Web files. :) Support for distributed, file sharing within group <i>if on Wifi</i>. Alternatively, on SDcards where they could just buy one, have one person who affords Internet pull the data, and pass the shared card(s) along to group members.<p>I like how you mix it being a paid service with tax deductions and donations. I predict you&#x27;ll probably put most or all of the services on the same infrastructure. What you can do is use the money that comes in for business or professional courses to cover creation of general ed material. The cash flow is split to cover each. The people making general ed material should have a track record of writing books or doing online courses that actually worked. They&#x27;ll adapt it to your model. They&#x27;ll have to change it for increased effectiveness as user feedback comes in like any other marketing. The cash flow also expands the distribution network so people with low income or poverty can access the material without overloading organization. A number of them might become contributors or paying users later.<p>So, those are some ideas I got as I read your application.",,nickpsecurity,,1477157325,2016-10-22T17:28:45Z,comment,12769587,12766517,,,

Being natural doesn&#x27;t make it good, but it does mean policies and expectations should be realistic. Singapore has achieved racial integration by very authoritarian measures like deciding where you can live and who your neighbors are, which was and is a realistic policy given the alternative outcome of just about everywhere else of racial groups bunching together against the outer culture which ends up causing various problems for the local government. In the absence of negative reinforcement like demonizing people who don&#x27;t at least appear welcoming to transpeople in the same way racists are demonized (this is the way I predict things going, sadly), and in the absence of well-enforced top-down measures, expectations should be for a long slog towards grudging acceptance of the state of the world.<p>I dream of a more grand future where I can just rewrite my personality(ies) to feel differently about various things, even to rewrite my brain and form a new body to experience what it&#x27;s truly like to be female, or Hutu.

,,"I would be interested in seeing the Supreme Court&#x27;s rationale that solitary confinement constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The four principles guiding the court are as follows from Wikipedia:<p>The &quot;essential predicate&quot; is &quot;that a punishment must not by its severity be degrading to human dignity,&quot; especially torture.<p>&quot;A severe punishment that is obviously inflicted in wholly arbitrary fashion.&quot;<p>&quot;A severe punishment that is clearly and totally rejected throughout society.&quot;<p>&quot;A severe punishment that is patently unnecessary.&quot;<p>The Eighth Amendment was copied virtually verbatim from the English Bill of Rights and wasn&#x27;t actually used to proclaim a particular punishment was unconstitutional until 1910, 119 years after the American Bill of Rights was ratified. Since then, the principles of &quot;proportionality&quot; and &quot;evolving standards of decency&quot; are evolving to ascertain constitutionality questions. Neither principle appears to do the trick.<p>Of the four principles above, only the first seems to apply. So the Court will have to declare that solitary confinement is torture in order to stop its widespread use. As seen, the Court has historically been cautious in declaring punishments unconstitutional, waiting until the battle has already been mostly fought in the sphere of public opinion.<p>Given the stances the Court has taken concerning the death penalty, I predict that no sweeping, immediate prohibitions will take place, rather the Court will apply largely ineffectual provisions to the imposition of solitary confinement.<p>For example, the Court has ruled in 2002 that capital punishment is constitutionally cruel and unusual when applied to inmates with intellectual disabilities. Georgia promptly responded by making it virtually impossible to obtain a judgment.",,vinceguidry,,1441300627,2015-09-03T17:17:07Z,comment,10166177,10164430,,,

My offer lets you do what you want.  If you think that extending medicare to federal workers is best, great.  (I predict that they'll revolt because I've never run into anyone with experience with both who would give up private for medicare.)<p>&#62; As to savings on ""paper trail"" is really a savings on the billing with 5 different insurance companies the doctor needs to handle each one separately<p>Except that it doesn't actually work that way, and the cost isn't significant.

And we get to observe.<p>And you get to deliver on the promise of lower costs.  Since medicare isn't cheaper (I'll deal with overhead below) and delivers worse care....<p>Of course, you also have the problem that doctors who have a choice tend to flee medicare.  If the private insurers are so hard to deal with, what does that say about govt?<p>&#62; Medicare is actually run at lower cost than most private insurance companies.<p>Actually, it isn't.  Medicare spends less money on one specific category of ""overhead"", but it spends far more on others.  (Govt's overall spending per covered person is basically the same as the private system's spending.  Medicare is actually worse than average for delivery vs cost.)<p>For example, the credible total medicare fraud estimates range from $150B to $250B/year.  (The low number is from AG Holder, who said ""more than"".)<p>This is despite the fact that folks who raise disputes with medicare are less likely to win than folks who have disputes with the private system.  What a deal - more fraud and more denied coverage.<p>The total profit of the private system is &#62;$10B/year.  And no, adding ""executive salaries"" doesn't significantly change that number.<p>The medicare fraud number alone dwarfs the supposed overhead of the private system, and the private system is bigger than medicare.<p>I'm sure that you've seen the ""free medical equipment"" ads on TV.

In almost every case, applicants can&#x27;t win what they don&#x27;t put in the middle -- which means that they have to apply if they meet even some of the position requirements.<p>Unfortunately, for every well-qualified applicant there are many less-qualified applicants, and the deluge of applicants means that it&#x27;s simply not possible to review each person individually. Instead they get run through a filter built from loose heuristics that try to capture job requirements.<p>I&#x27;ve long felt that the solution here is the same as a busy nightclub: charge a cover.

It&#x27;s not about penalizing applicants, it&#x27;s about encouraging applicants to be honest about the fit between their skills and the position requirements. I predict there would certainly be fewer applicants failing FizzBuzz.<p>Employers are also hypersensitive to false positives (candidates who don&#x27;t work out), and a (justified) fear that they&#x27;ll invest in a candidate who will move on after learning and maturing in the company. It sucks having to fire someone who isn&#x27;t working out, and it can hurt morale even if the employee wasn&#x27;t producing. The cost of onboarding, training, and firing a candidate sets a high threshold against false positives. It&#x27;s just as bad when a new employee is working out well but leaves abruptly for a better offer. I don&#x27;t have a solution to the former, but the latter is usually a good indication that you need to review your compensation policies and the overall competitive positioning of your total package compared to the market.

Android was a BRILLIANTLY timed play that stopped an Apple monopoly in modern smartphones in its tracks. Just think for a second what the current mobile landscape would look like had android not come out exactly within the quarter that it did.<p>While we have yet to see the effects of ChromeOS, its release will no doubt be massively disruptive, and the ability to recognize the different functionality both operating systems serve and launch both consecutively despite the fact that it looks like a very odd play to the naive masses, takes balls and isn't something I would say ANY other company even a twentieth the size of Google would attempt, and I predict this will pay off in the end.<p>I also disagree that Wave, TV and Buzz lacked discipline and oversight. Not everything a company can do is going to be a revolutionary success. A lot of times markets just need to be probed or explored, and if there's a hit great but if not there's no huge loss of resources and returns will still be made in some form or another (eg. wave code being reused in Docs or buzz maybe showing up as part of another social product in the future).

A founder who used to be a former user and can point to the flaws in everything on the market and came up with a better solution is an IDEAL person to have start something.  Their intuition is based on their experience of what people like them (ie, former customers) will PAY MONEY for.  That's a business.  Hackers hacking all night is not a business.

That's why 99.99% of programmers who start businesses flop - they're so wrapped up in some tiny aspect of their warped reality and how their awesome code makes a tiny part of it a bit better in ways nobody understands, that they never stop and think that 99.99% of the general population of who they think will be their customers couldn't care less.<p>That's if they even bother to think about who their customers will be.  Most programmers can't think beyond ""users"" and I'm sorry, but now that we're entering recession times, you'll learn really quick that users does NOT equal same as paying customer.<p>The sad truth for you is that most successful companies were started by people without the technical skills but who were users of many things, had a ""big picture perspective"" and thought to themselves, ""You know what sucks about the current state of things, this, this and that - someone should make something different like this and this.""<p>Otherwise, from your model, you just have programmers making something most likely nobody will care about.

,,"Even after innumberable discussions about this subject, I still don't get why people are so afraid of NAT.<p>The main concern seems to be about ISPs starting to NAT everybody and their dog. Well, guess what, they just can't do that. For starters because their users would get very angry when their torrents stop working, and would jump ship for any other ISP that announces that it either doesn't do NAT or has implemented IPv6.<p>There is still a huge amount of work that can be done to compress the usage of v4 address space. Maybe not much that the RIRs or the ISPs can do, but as the cost of owning a static IPv4 address goes up (and I believe that it will go _way_ up), end users will start compressing their public services into fewer addresses and giving back small subnets to their providers to reduce costs. I mean, who the hell needs to have a mail server and a web server in two different public addresses when they can just do port-forwarding over a single address? (And since most servers are on DMZs with private addressing, they are mostly doing it already, it's just a matter of renumbering.)<p>The case most likely to go NAT is also the most likely to go IPv6: mobile devices. These are mostly behind NAT already, and going IPv6 would actually reduce costs for ISPs. It would also put ISPs in the track for more extensive IPv6, since the major problem now is that people have little knowledge of how IPv6 works and ISPs are trying to avoid the pain. The issue is, of course, that 99.9% of mobile devices don't support dual-stack and even in a pure v6 configuration don't actually work properly.<p>For this I predict that in 10 years the move to IPv6 will still be half-way.

Increased traffic density would seem likely to have a positive correlation with accident rates that would partially offset the decrease you're hoping to see.<p>During the transition period, I predict you'd see a marked increase in the accident rate due to the increased instances of overtaking and broader spread of speeds.

It&#x27;s really not the best software that wins the wallets of consumers, but the best marketing — same for music, movies, vacation destinations, virtually any product: marketing &#x27;bypasses&#x27; quality (it just needs to be &#x27;good enough&#x27;) by &#x27;brute-forcing&#x27; awareness and familiarity (sheer repetition, seduction, etc). It&#x27;s true there&#x27;s a lasting power to great UX (ask Apple), but Linux desktop never even entered that phase for the mainstream (first you have to exist before we even ask if you&#x27;re going to last).<p>Making the best Linux experience is thus a vain enterprise. It just won&#x27;t sell more or less (if we agree that even free has a cost), it just won&#x27;t bootstrap massive adoption. It&#x27;s at best preparing the product for its encounter with the public, but it&#x27;s not making said encounter more likely.<p>A strategy like Microsoft&#x27;s with Windows shows where the battle of OS&#x27;s is fought and won: with OEMs.<p>Microsoft correctly identified (just like Intel) in the 1990&#x27;s that people would buy computers (thus OS, thus CPU) through middlemen, OEMs, the Dell&#x27;s and HP&#x27;s and ASUS&#x27;s of the world. So that&#x27;s who you need to sell on your product.<p>Apple is its own OEM, as they integrate vertically, and indeed the &#x27;integration&#x27; between hard- and soft-wares is what sold most of us who ever bought into OS X or iOS et. al. The interesting take is that Apple for the longest time oscillates between 5 and 15% market share on average on all their products worldwide (much closer to 50% on star products in the US, nigh-zero in the poorest markets), and this is the nonetheless <i>massive</i> (9 figures) user base that guarantees adoption of their OS, which are designed entirely to sell the hardware by making it shine (what MS is now trying to do with Surface lead by Panos Panay, or Google with Pixels and other things).<p>This whole &#x27;integration&#x27; space is where Linux never even tried itself, it seems, because there&#x27;s never been a &quot;Linux Marketing Department&quot; nor a &quot;Linux Sales Person&quot; — when Dell does Linux, it&#x27;s because a bunch of fans inside the company made it their project; when Red Hat sells Linux it&#x27;s closer to the goal with OEMs but certainly not mainstream&#x2F;consumer in that case. As for Ubuntu, I don&#x27;t know who they sell to; they&#x27;re certainly big on the servers, but absent of consumer laptops despite being totally usable these days (and most consumers certainly don&#x27;t need the advanced features of paid O365, so that debate is moot in this case). There are Linux brands (notably System76 with their awesome PopOS), but they also don&#x27;t target the mainstream it seems, or not in a &#x27;big&#x27; way likely to turn market figures around.<p>The truth is that I don&#x27;t think anyone with big-tech decision power really cares now that we&#x27;ve moved to IaaS and serving apps on containers (alternatively &#x27;minified&#x27; through some CD pipeline from a common base) is going to increasingly become the &#x27;easy&#x27; way to have apps &#x27;just work&#x27;; and by that point who cares if it&#x27;s Windows, Linux or even iOS in the kernel underneath.

At the time, I told him to go to the most prestigious academic medical center in his area and not to trust the average primary care doctors.<p>So I assume he's done that already.  How else do you explain 18 years of going to doctor after doctor without any improvement.<p>Suppose he'd instead said that he'd been to astrologer after astrologer and found no improvement, in spite of the recent realization of the placement of Mars.  You'd probably not tell him to keep trying to find an astrological explanation... so why are you so confident that there is a medical explanation right around the corner?<p>The body has incredible ability to heal itself.  By following my advice (after 18 years of following yours) he may actually stumble upon some information that helps lead toward a solution.  For example:<p>- Maybe he gets no exercise at present because he uses what energy he has for work.<p>- Maybe he has a rare food sensitivity.  If so, eating the diet I suggested may make it much better or much worse.  In either case he gains information.<p>- Going to a relaxing place (CR has the happiest population in the world) will help alleviate all the existential stress he's taken on after 18 years of dealing with this illness.<p>My suggestions are based on big picture lifestyle approaches that actually do work.  Medicine does not even remotely consider suggesting such a therapy because most people could never actually follow it.  I predict that if you could do a study where people followed the therapy I proposed you'd find it was more effective than many of the most lauded pharmaceuticals and surgical techniques in use today for a variety of ailments.<p>There is also the chance that this guy has some exceptionally rare condition that is not even known/understood by medical science.

,,"The great surge of technology patents started around 1990 and had really picked up steam by 1995 [1]. Patents, unlike Copyrights, are not 'renewable' in the sense that once their 20 year term expires they revert to the public domain by law. Further, now that folks have successfully litigated bogus Patent Marking [2] you can't use an old Patent number on your design to intimidate folks into not copying it.<p>So while filing rates continue to be high (although as you see from the linked graph issue rates have been falling) the patent office has become better educated about what should be and what shouldn't be patentable (not perfect yet but its getting noticeably better, if only because patent examiners are entering the market who grew up in a digital age).<p>So a side effect is that when the patent claims for issued patents expire, that's it, no more revenue. You can perfectly legally implement the RSA key exchange algorithm now (as an example) without infringing on any patents. This was speculated to be the primary reason that RSA Data Security Inc was trying to get people signed up to use their <i>Copyrighted</i> implementation of same, since if you licensed the copyrighted code, and then decided to stop paying them license fees and implement it yourself they couldn't sue you for patent infringement but they would want to go through your code to see that you hadn't used large parts of their software in your new design. That approach was unavailable if you hadn't been given access to their source code.<p>So starting in 2010, and accelerating until 2020 <i>all</i> of those patents that were issued between 1990 and 2000 will revert to being public domain. It is one of the reasons I predict a tech boom in 2015 - 2025 :-).<p>I did not anticipate however that prior to their death that these companies would go all out in try to extract some, possibly any, value from them by suing the pants off everyone.

,,"I think there&#x27;s an art and technology to reusable components. This reifies &quot;architecture&quot; into something which can be slowly built up by the community as reusable tools. Lacking this technology one instead must fall to &quot;frameworks&quot; as the unit of shared community development.<p>This is directly related to one&#x27;s ability to spin off a library containing a generalizable component of functionality and have it be repeatedly reused. My belief is that this is actually far harder than it ought to be in most languages. Actually, worse than that, most languages and the style of their libraries as supported by the community cause tradeoffs which penalize reusability quite harshly.<p><pre><code>    * It&#x27;s difficult to manage documentation of interfaces
    * Abstractions leak *heavily* and therefore have 
      exponentially complex &quot;spooky interaction at a distance&quot;
    * Breaking algorithms into chunks must be done at 
      boundaries defined by efficiencies instead of as
      defined by meaning (implementation privileged over spec)
</code></pre>
Experienced Haskell users often talk about this story: that Haskell was the first language they ever used which actually felt reusable. This arose from the combination of powerful types, pure code, and laziness. The types provide clear, unbreakable interfaces between libraries. The purity ensures that libraries play together well and can be combined in more ways due to no &quot;spooky interaction at a distance&quot;. The laziness ensures that when you cut sequences of computation into pieces you can recompose them later without losing efficiency.<p>I&#x27;m not going to claim that Haskell has figured out modularity, but I do think it&#x27;s massively better than the status quo here. The upshot is that Cabal Hell is in part caused by the fact that nobody quite knows how to handle such massive modularity in practice.<p>Where that&#x27;s relevant, I think, to this post is that without a genuine case for reusable modularity—supported at the language and the community levels—it is much harder to invest your time into reusable things and instead you focus efforts on frameworks. Lacking the technology to have legos we choose between prefab houses.<p>I think the best way for Javascript, i.e., to move forward away from framework driven development is to double down on the community&#x27;s investment in purity as neither types nor laziness are ever going to be core to the language. This has already occurred in a small way with things like the virtual dom technique (which can be easily made immutable and updated purely) and the rise of things like Mori and Immutable.js.<p>As this pattern grows I predict the ability for people to genuinely build applications from well-cut, reusable components will become far more of a reality and the &quot;framework epoch&quot; will slowly close.",,tel,,1428061692,2015-04-03T11:48:12Z,comment,9315325,9314636,,,

,,"Agreed. Javascript is increasingly something that is optional. You can use it but you no longer have to use it. And even if you are using it, you are more than likely transpiling it. Browser side Javascript is just a compiler target at this point. There are a minority of people not doing any transpilation of course. But at this point that really is a minority (and by no small margin I&#x27;m guessing). Nothing against that, but &quot;native&quot; javascript just stopped being a mainstream thing quite a few years ago.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean Javascript will go away but it does mean it now has to compete on merit rather than relying on it&#x27;s status as the only thing that you can actually use in a browser. Many projects have already shifted to using Typescript for example. And from there to other transpiled languages is not that big of a leap. We use Kotlin-js for example. It&#x27;s great. Other people use clojure, vue, elm or other languages that basically aren&#x27;t javascript but that just happen to transpile to it.<p>Long term WASM is a more efficient compiler target. Smaller, faster, easier to deal with for compiler builders, etc. The only remaining reasons to target browser js with your compiler, is that it still has better bindings to the browser APIs. This is something that is being worked on and of course that is more than offset by being able to compile existing libraries to WASM.<p>WASM has a few other things as well that are still being worked on (threading, memory management&#x2F;garbage collections, etc.). But long term, anything that javascript can do in a browser would be something you could do from a WASM compiled program as well. Once that works well enough, a lot more languages will start targeting browser applications just because they can. And a lot of developers that don&#x27;t necessarily care about downgrading to Javascript might have a go at doing some applications that run in a browser. I predict a little renaissance in frameworks and tooling for this.<p>And of course with WebGL and Canvas, using the DOM and CSS is entirely optional. For example Figma has a nice UI that looks like it would be hard to match with anything DOM based. They have a bit of react on the side for the bits that don&#x27;t really matter but most of the app is C++. People also run games, virtual machines, etc. in browsers. There might still be valid reasons to use DOM + CSS like we have been for the last two decades. But it won&#x27;t be the only choice for doing UIs. And being limited by it like we have been is increasingly no longer necessary either.",,jillesvangurp,,1644509496,2022-02-10T16:11:36Z,comment,30288248,30287195,,,

salaries up in competition.<p>Unless the skills are not actually high skilled, but <i>obscure skills</i>.  I predict that ""high skilled manufacturing"" is a morass of proprietary solutions to 
highly specific process needs - that is, the metal fabrication plant alluded to at 10USD per hour has highly specific machinery doing a fixed task, and that the skill is mostly one of repairing the proprietary code.<p>From a software perspective, that mostly means the machinery is ""legacy"" - and impossible to refactor.  So it can never be improved upon, only replaced.<p>I am not a 3d-printer fanboi - the advantages of additative manufacturing are hugely over hyped (at the moment), and likely to remain elusive for, lets say, a generation, before it becomes obvious to all we throw away factories and their jobs and build millions of thing-o-matics.<p>However in that generation there will be huge opportunity for semi-general manufacturing - robots with sufficient flexibility in parts and software that they can be re-purposed easily as part of a (virtual) conveyor belt.<p>This sounds truly skilled work - flexibly adapting as processes and customers change.<p>if providing semi-general manufacturing machines is uneconomic compared to proprietary simpler but ""obscure skill"" machines, then we cannot expect a productivity

,,"Good arguments. Though there is one difference I can see between virtualizing memory and virtualizing other resources, like the file system or the network. (note, I&#x27;m pretty much a container newbie).<p>Process memory has traditionally been an &quot;implementation detail&quot; of the process. It typically doesn&#x27;t need to be shared, the addresses do not need to be fixed, etc. (Shared memory is an exception of course).<p>Resource like the file system or network, on the other hand are mostly shared. It does matter to the outside world through which port the program is reachable, it matters where it puts its files, etc. Again, there are exceptions of course, like temporary files.<p>Now the question is how can we pull out the configuration, like &quot;what port must the program listen on?&quot;, and decide these tasks centrally. The container solution is (if I understand correctly) that the program will always listen on port 80, but the container configuration diverts that port to be accessible to the outside world as 8080, etc.<p>I predict that this is going to be a failure in the same sense that OOP has been a failure (if you agree with me on that point).

The program should not be required to define its own configuration for all the problems which containers want to deal with today. Instead it should import this configuration from a central location through a well-known interface.<p>There must be a simple convention where these decisions can be configured. The configuration must be easily accessible to A) the system, B) the program, C) the administrator. It&#x27;s been customary to put configurations in text files for a long time, and that&#x27;s mostly good. However what&#x27;s been missing is that most programs have had their own configuration file written in a custom syntax and stored in a location that are not easily known by the rest of the system. The system is not really aware that the program is configured e.g. to listen on port 80. And the administrator needs to learn new configuration files for every program.<p>I&#x27;m not proposing a central registry where all the cruft of the system should accumulate. Instead, just for the concepts that are shared by many programs -- the resources which containers virtualize today -- should be configured through a system-wide API.",,jstimpfle,,1519386180,2018-02-23T11:43:00Z,comment,16445713,16445620,,,

,,"""How well does the SAT I predict first-year college grades? The College Board and ETS conduct periodic studies of the SAT I. This usually involves examining the relationship between test scores and first-year college grades, generally expressed as the correlation coefficient (or r value). The College Board's Handbook for the SAT Program 2000-2001 claims the SAT-V and SAT-M have a correlation of .47 and .48, respectively, with freshman GPA (FGPA). This number is deceptive, however. To determine how much of the difference in first-year grades between students the SAT I really predicts, the correlation coefficient must be multiplied by itself. The result, called r squared, describes the difference (or variation) among college freshman grades. Thus, the predictive ability (or r squared) of the SAT I is just .22, meaning the test explains only 22% of the variation in freshman grades. With a correlation of .54, high school grades alone do a better job, explaining almost 30% of the variance in first-year college performance.""<p><a href=""http://www.fairtest.org/facts/satvalidity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fairtest.org/facts/satvalidity.html</a>",,Alex3917,,1207620645,2008-04-08T02:10:45Z,comment,157423,157395,,,

It runs adequately fast, and has JVM threading, meaning that ceteris paribus it is 'fast enough' for the largely IO-bound tasks that make up web-programming. And when you program in JRuby you find yourself leaning on the Java libraries for most of the heavy-duty stuff (say what you like about Java, I certainly do, but the libraries are abundant and abundantly production-worthy). Ultimately, when you've got lambda and reasonably low-impedance hash tables then you can make everything else, so there's a future for Ruby.<p>Python on the other hand is a lost cause. Objects are a valid and important ingredient in a balanced diet of programming abstractions, but 'object-oriented programming' is for idiots or assholes or worse. Objects  as a first-class language feature are nice-but-optional, I've worked on large C systems written in an object oriented style (one was a simulation, another was a widget toolkit, both had 'object' as a meaningful native domain concept). First-class functions OTOH are not optional, without them you've designed a language for infants. If you are designing a modern high-level programming language and you choose to cripple lambda (either because you've made regrettable decisions about your syntax that prevents their expression, or because you want to put training-wheels on the language itself, or LOL both) then you're an asshole, full stop. Python's scoping is tragic, at least Larry and Brendan had the humility to admit they fucked up and add reasonable scoping. GVR isn't wrong, 30 years of hard-won experience with correct lexical scoping is. If you think Scheme is wrong then I've got news for you: you are. Funny, now that I think about it it's not even about right and wrong anymore, it's about 'Pythonicity', which basically means that not only is GVR never wrong, if you don't agree then you're some kind of barbaric programming-language outsider.

,,"One point I&#x27;ve made in alignment with this is to ask why decentralized systems are inherently more private.<p>Most decentralized systems seem to have more surface area for surveillance, not less. Why couldn&#x27;t surveillance agencies and data-grabbing corporations just launch a bunch of &quot;Sybil&quot; nodes to surveil everyone? These would be virtually undetectable as they would be otherwise well behaved nodes and could be put behind ordinary looking cloud or ISP connections. Most shared data stores can be trivially scanned and data mined, decentralized networks like DHTs can be crawled, decentralized apps can be MITMed with Sybils and honey pots, and so on.<p>I predict that if any decentralized or federated system really becomes popular enough to merit attention from data-grabbers we will see the launch of an industry of companies and consulting services dedicated to mining and surveilling it. Security is hard, and security across a heterogenous decentralized network run by users and volunteers is many times harder.<p>I suppose you can see something analogous in the cryptocurrency space. I&#x27;ve argued for a while that Bitcoin and similar CC systems were in fact rapidly compromised, but not by attacking their cryptography or protocols. They were compromised via social engineering and financial game playing that transformed them from currencies of the sort they were intended to be into decentralized Ponzi schemes and money laundering vehicles. They were taken over and repurposed, not taken down or hacked in the conventional sense. The same thing would probably happen to e.g. Matrix or Mastodon if it got popular enough. Companies and governments would just assimilate and repurpose these things into surveillance and spam-delivery vehicles. With superior resources and economic forcing functions this would be quite easy.<p>A centralized system has a single point of failure, but that also limits attack surface.

You'd probably not tell him to keep trying to find an astrological explanation... so why are you so confident that there is a medical explanation right around the corner?<p>Because each and every of his symptoms ties in with at least two fairly common and very serious conditions that are in spite of being so common routinely mis-diagnosed and/or mistreated.<p>&#62; The body has incredible ability to heal itself.<p>Right, let's use the power of our minds to heal. Some guy not personally known to you comes with a veritable laundry list of symptoms and instead of sticking to tried and true medicine you want him to practice yoga.<p>&#62; By following my advice (after 18 years of following yours) he may actually stumble upon some information that helps lead toward a solution.<p>Or he may waste 3 more months on a trajectory that seems to be deteriorating to the point that he's asking total strangers for help. Not that we're going to be able to give him concrete advice, only a <i>very</i> qualified doctor could do that. But instead you advise him to get away from it all.<p>&#62; - Maybe he gets no exercise at present because he uses what energy he has for work.<p>&#62; - Maybe he has a rare food sensitivity. If so, eating the diet I suggested may make it much better or much worse. In either case he gains information.<p>It may be, or it may not be. But changing so many variables at once is never going to give him information, you do that by keeping a diary and slow variation over time so you can isolate a cause.<p>&#62; - Going to a relaxing place (CR has the happiest population in the world) will help alleviate all the existential stress he's taken on after 18 years of dealing with this illness.<p>That's great, and I'm sure the Tourist Board of Costa Rica approves of your message. But that's not medical advice.<p>&#62; My suggestions are based on big picture lifestyle approaches that actually do work. Medicine does not even remotely consider suggesting such a therapy because most people could never actually follow it. I predict that if you could do a study where people followed the therapy I proposed you'd find it was more effective than many of the most lauded pharmaceuticals and surgical techniques in use today for a variety of ailments.<p>Poppycock. Surgery and medication when needed are effective ways of dealing with a large variety of ailments, and good lifestyle can help you avoid those for a long time.<p>Lots of people die on an annual basis because of following the well meant advice of quacks that have little knowledge and too much self confidence.<p>Red flag right there ""Medicine does not even remotely consider suggesting such a therapy because most people could never actually follow it"", if a change in life style was all that is needed to treat Chron's, Lyme's and a whole pile of other serious diseases you can bet that plenty of people would be following it.<p>I'm not saying that there are no individuals that would not benefit from changing their lifestyle, but we can't <i>all</i> live in Costa Rica and even some of those that could follow it might end up seriously dead if their conditions are not treated by an application of medical knowledge.<p>&#62; There is also the chance that this guy has some exceptionally rare condition that is not even known/understood by medical science.

A multi-trillion dollar initiative and the corresponding policy changes would ripple through the incredibly complex system we call the economy, affecting everyone, and not in a completely proportional and &quot;fair&quot; manner.  From my years of close observation of the behavior of the various actors in democratic political systems, I predict this could affect sentiment and therefore voting patterns, to a consequential degree.  Keep in mind though, this is only a prediction, I am unable to see into the future.<p>&quot;...so we can&#x27;t do it...&quot;<p>This on its own <i>seems</i> factual, but not for the reason you stated.  At the very least, it is speculative.<p>&quot;...and instead spin our tires with dumb nit-picking articles like this one.&quot;<p>I strongly disagree that this article is &quot;stupid&quot;, but rather, I think it is right on the money, and is drawing attention to an incredibly important and incredibly overlooked underlying (potential) cause of our inability to move the ball forward on the climate change initiative.<p>FTA:<p>&gt; Journalists and activists alike have an obligation to describe environmental problems honestly and accurately, even if they fear doing so will reduce their news value or salience with the public. There is good evidence that the catastrophist framing of climate change is self-defeating <i>because it alienates and polarizes many people</i>.<p>....who then often proceed to vote, illogically, in a &quot;fuck you&quot; manner. [0]<p>I often read sentiments about climate &quot;deniers&quot;[1] being &quot;the children in the room&quot;, and people like[2] yourself being &quot;the adults&quot;.  I can agree that there is some truth to this, but I would argue less than meets the eye.<p>My intuition tells me a more accurate description would be something like:  the &quot;deniers&quot; are the children, &quot;people like you&quot; are the teenagers, &quot;people like the author&quot; are &quot;the young adults&quot;, and the people that recognize that what we&#x27;re doing <i>just isn&#x27;t working</i>, decide to calm down and start looking deeply at details, taking into consideration the infinite complexity of the numerous inter-related systems involved (one of which is the human mind), paying close attention to the nature of conversations and making note of where things may be going off track, come up with <i>some new ideas</i>, and try to get those ideas out into the meme war.....these are the <i>actual</i> adults in the room.<p>To me, tackling climate change with science and facts is similar to bringing a knife to a gunfight.  People don&#x27;t think in facts, because that isn&#x27;t how we evolved.  Purely factual thinking mutations are culled from the herd by evolution, because it doesn&#x27;t produce results.  Historically for sure, but the same argument could be made today, at least within most domains.<p>We can deal with reality as it &quot;should&quot; be, or we can deal with it how it is.  That choice is up to each and every one of us, each and every time we interact with these and similar issues.<p>(I speculate that) We all <i>think</i> we&#x27;re worried &quot;just&quot; about the climate change, <i>because our senses tell us that</i>.  But is that all that&#x27;s going on here?  The intense emotions we each feel when reading such discussions, are those emotions purely derived from pure logical thinking about the future state of the climate, or might they be in part a result of reactions to subconscious heuristic interpretations of the words others are writing, resulting in a subconscious classification of the person into an in-group or out-group categorization, which in turn results in signals being sent up to the conscious mind to react in a certain manner, which sets off a chain of events which are hilariously counter-productive to our conscious, logical, intended goals. (An example of this curiously complex behavior would be the brain sending signals to the hand to move one&#x27;s mousepointer over top of one of two available diamonds beside this comment, and then a signal to depress the left mouse button, as an expression of...<i>something</i>, but exactly what is not discernible to an outside observer.  It may not even be accurately discernible to the person operating the mouse, such is the beautiful complexity of the human mind).<p>My proposal is that we cool our jets and realize what is actually going on here, and use the substantial intellectual power that exists within the HN hivemind to start to come up with some better ideas.  Battling climate change is a multi-dimensional problem, but we seem to be aware of only a subset of these dimensions.  Scientists, politicians, &quot;journalists&quot;, and media celebrities are helpful (at times at least), but I believe there are many crucially important disciplines that have been excluded from the conversation - in part because we&#x27;re thinking about the problem wrong, in part because we often think of those disciplines as &quot;stupid&quot; or trivial.<p>This thinking may be right, or it may be wrong.  But at the end of the day, we are going to find out one way or the other.  Let&#x27;s hope we&#x27;ve guessed right, because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing here so far: <i>guessing</i>.  Educated guesses perhaps, but still guesses.<p>As the saying goes: as we sow, so shall we reap.  This statement is true regardless of humanity&#x27;s current collective agreement on the matter - the universe will unfold as it will.  We can let this process occur randomly, or we can intervene and attempt to shape it more to our liking, but being successful in that endeavor requires a proper analysis, and proper action.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vMm5HfxNXY4"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vMm5HfxNXY4</a><p>[1] &quot;deniers&quot; are often not actually that, but let&#x27;s not get hung up on trivialities like facts.<p>[2] I say &quot;like&quot; here as a generalization, but am reserving judgement on whether you are actually such a person - this footnote is to make it explicitly clear that my statement is speculative.",,mistermann,,1574873320,2019-11-27T16:48:40Z,comment,21649468,21648784,,,

,,"Unfortunately the US legal system is not defendant friendly. While the US claims &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; our legal system is structured opposite. The other, larger in my opinion, problem is that the focus has gone from using common sense to zero tolerance. This case is a prime example. I am not by any means support child pornography, but at the same time the sex offender laws in the US are out of control. Take for example a friend of mine who was drunk and got peeing in front of car on a dark street. A cop just happened to see him and he was subsequently arrested, charged, and convicted of indecent exposure. Because of the conviction he had to register as a sex offender. The US sex offender registry makes no distinction though between the individual caught peeing in the alley and the person who has molested hundreds of kids. The bigger issue is that no politician will touch correcting the situation for fear of being labeled as support child pornography. So while everyone knows the system is screwed up, and people continued to be punished harshly because of it, nothing will change because everyone is so scared to talk about the problem in the first place.<p>There are many other cases, outside of sex offenses, where individuals who may be guilty of a lesser crime take a plea deal to a larger crime to avoid the cost, time, and most importantly uncertainty associated with going to trial. I think, at least with sex offenses, we will see in the future a shift in dealing with the problem though. It is somewhat like drugs. In the early 1980s Reagan was hard-nosed on the war on drugs. He enacted stiff penalties and encouraged three strike laws. This sent a lot of people to jail for a long time on charges that were otherwise non-offenses. You see people in California serving life sentences for having three charges of possession of marijuana. Today though as a younger generation comes into power, and people are slowly changing their views on marijuana, we are seeing a shift in punishment for the same crimes. I predict that at some point there will be tipping point with crimes like this article highlight where people will say enough is enough we need to fix this problem.

,,"Before industrialization, land that mattered was farmland. Then as industrialization took hold, urban land became more important as the grouping of people together allowed for economies of scale in manufacturing. But then the petrochemical revolution put things in reverse, as people could live anywhere and travel by car. Suddenly, open space was economically desirable, as it made more sense to build a factory in super-cheap Nowheresville, Arkansas than crowded, expensive Philadelphia.<p>But the rise in global supply chains - the shipping container in particular - meant that it makes more sense to build just about everything in a few massive hubs (Shenzhen as the prime example), and then ship things all around the world, at a much cheaper rate than if the widget or smartphone were made at home. Likewise for services, like IT and finance, it makes much more sense for all of these professionals to work together in the same places, which is why a handful of cities are crushing the Information Age while hundreds of other towns and cities are either dying slowly or are on life support (higher education economy, tax-break-driven manufacturing, etc)<p>Will we see the same resurgence of sprawl as followed the petrochemical revolution?

I don’t see any market manipulation here[1], considering activist investors have set a precedent for make hyperbolic statements which are mostly unchallenged, so long as there is a nontrivial kernel of truth.<p>Material, nonpublic information is of course not illegal to trade on, on its own. It’s not generally illegal to trade on unpublished vulnerabilities. But it’s routine to be forcibly entered into a confidentiality agreement as part of the process of <i>reporting</i> a vulnerability. For example, reporting a vulnerability through Bugcrowd or Hackerone would immediately make it illegal for you to trade on the knowledge of the vulnerability.<p>I assume the researchers were savvy enough to report the vulnerability in such a way that did not enter them into a confidentiality agreement. That said, AMD may lean on the widespread commonalities of how many responsible disclosure processes <i>do</i> work with respect to confidentiality in order to try and establish a precedent. They’ll make arguments about reasonable disclosure windows before publication, etc. This is, to my eyes, the best case for someone trying to bring a case forward. If the researchers implicitly agreed to a confidentiality agreement (for example, if the page with security contact information has “browsewrap” terms and conditions, or if buying an AMD product at all has such terms), it will be messy, but they’ll be <i>probably</i> fine, I think.<p>However, if they actually reported the vulnerability through a medium that explicitly forces confidentiality, I think they’re actually screwed.<p>__________________________<p>1.

,,"The problem I have with these design choices is that I predict lots of subtle off by one bugs and crashes because of non-ascii inputs in the future of Julia. I <i>hope</i> that I am wrong :)<p>&gt; Yes, it&#x27;s a little awkward, but to understand why this tradeoff was made, think about how you&#x27;d get the nth character in a UTF-8 string. There is a tradeoff between intuitive O(n) string indexing by characters and O(1) string indexing by bytes.<p>I understand the problem of UTF-8 character vs. byte addressing and O(n) vs. O(1) and I have thought about the problem long and hard. And I don&#x27;t claim to have a &quot;correct&quot; solution, this is a tricky tradeoff one way or the other.<p>I think that Julia &quot;does the right thing&quot; but perhaps exposes it to the programmer in a bit funny manner that is prone to runtime errors.<p>&gt; The way out that some programming languages have chosen is to store your strings as UTF-16, and use O(1) indexing by two-byte sequence.<p>Using UTF-16 is a horrible idea in many ways, it doesn&#x27;t solve the variable width encoding problem of UTF-8 but still consumes twice the memory.<p>&gt; The other way out is to store all of your strings as UTF-32&#x2F;UCS-4. I&#x27;m not sure any programming language does this, because using 4x as much memory for ASCII strings and making string manipulation significantly slower as a result (particularly for medium-sized strings that would have fit in L1 cache as UTF-8 but can&#x27;t as UCS-4) is not really a great design decision.<p>This solves the variable width encoding issue at the cost of 4x memory use. Your concern about performance and cache performance is a valid one.<p>However, I would like to see a comparison of some real world use case how this performs. There will be a performance hit, that is for sure but how big is it in practice?<p>In my opinion, the string type in a language should be targeted at short strings (long strings are some hundreds of characters, typically strings around 32 or so) and have practical operations for that. For long strings (kilobytes to megabytes) of text, another method (some kind of bytestring or &quot;text&quot; type) should be used. For a short string, a 4x memory use doesn&#x27;t sound that bad but your point about caches is still valid.<p>&gt; Instead of O(n) string indexing by characters, Julia has fast string indexing by bytes with chr2ind and nextind functions to get byte indexes by character index, and iterating over strings gives 4-byte characters. Is this the appropriate tradeoff? That depends on your taste.<p>This is <i>obviously</i> the right thing to do when you store strings in UTF-8.<p>My biggest concern is that there will be programs that crash when given non-ascii inputs. The biggest change I would have made is that str[n] should not throw a runtime error as long as n is within bounds.<p>Some options I can think of are: 1) str[n] returns n&#x27;th byte  2) str[n] returns character at n&#x27;th byte or some not-a-character value  3) Get rid of str[n] altogether and replace it with str.bytes()[n] (O(1)) and str.characters()[n] (where characters() returns some kind of lazy sequence if possible, O(n))<p>You&#x27;re right, this boils down to a matter of taste. And my <i>opinion</i> is that crashing at runtime should always be avoided if it is possible by changing the design.<p>&gt; But I don&#x27;t think that additional computer science knowledge would have made this problem any easier.<p>There is a certain difference in &quot;get things done&quot; vs. &quot;do it right&quot; mentality between people who use computers for science and computer scientists.

,,"For now.<p>In the longer term, gassing up will end up not so much the norm.  Has to. (well, technically not until we find ourselves in a state of extraction where the cost exceeds the returns, which may not be all that long)<p>Right now, my commute fits roughly into many EV ranges, but the savings is dubious.  I can get 40+ MPG in my second economy car.<p>The first one was an older Corolla.  89, and it got 35 to 40Mpg, if I was careful with it.  The newer one is an 01 Honda Accord, and it&#x27;s roughly the same performance, but I need to be a little bit more careful as that one can actually perform a little.  Fine, nice option.<p>In terms of dollars per mile?  No contest.  Both cars cost 2K, and I&#x27;ll get 100 - 200K miles out of them with few hassles.  I do most of the work, and will get stuck with the odd thing I need to have a shop do, or want to have them do.<p>Gas will have to go up a lot to unbalance that equation.  And as for environmental...  it&#x27;s still a mixed bag.  Lots of ugly rare earths going into those newer cars, right along with all the production energy use.<p>I predict we will continue to see a decline in new gasoline &#x2F; diesel car sales as people wait for EVs to gain cost advantages.  Used vehicles, perhaps modified some to improve emissions &#x2F; performance (I do that now mostly myself), will prove increasingly compelling due to the very solid, production proven engineering paying off very nicely right now.  It&#x27;s insane just how long a car can go with a little maintenance and such.<p>We may see cool things like hydrogen.  Toyota is working on that big time right now.<p>There already is alcohol, and both have advantages and disadvantages, with alcohol basically being a drop in, pretty friendly, reasonably performant, reasonably cost effective drop in replacement for gas.  Same stations, infrastructure, etc... all just works.<p>Many cars can be converted reasonably.<p>There will be a considerable time where people will own cars longer, modify, refurbish, and trade while EV infrastructure continues to ramp up, and competing tech enters, all the costs get sorted.<p>My point here is we are entering a more turbulent time.  Many of us will have more options.  They may be offered up and see some scale, and in some cases, may just be things people choose to do.  I could put my wife on a moderate range EV and she may never actually need anything else.  Can always use the other car, or rent, for example.<p>That &quot;anti-salespitch&quot; won&#x27;t really be seen that way here soon.  Picking some options and matching that up to life requirements &#x2F; needs &#x2F; wants will seem increasingly ordinary.<p>One thing I do really think will prove useful a bit too late is how GM chose to implement the Volt.<p>The Volt is an actual EV, and works like one for short ranges.  Too short, just a bit too short.  However, it can recharge on it&#x27;s internal fuel engine, or plug in, whatever.<p>It&#x27;s not a hybrid, more like an EV with it&#x27;s own self-contained recharging option.<p>Volts, converted to use something very friendly, such as alcohol, may well prove out to be seriously great options for people who have a wide, or dynamic range of driving requirements.<p>I kind of want one, while I can get one reasonably.  Modify it...<p>We may also see a secondary industry pop up.  Take great cars, add on, modify, convert, whatever to make them more receptive to more energy options.<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t see it as an anti-salespitch.  It can be seen that way by those of us fat &#x27;n happy on whatever fuel we are using right now.  That&#x27;s me for sure.  I&#x27;ve got my costs waaaaay down.<p>Edit:  And though my scenario is seriously cheap, it doesn&#x27;t have to be.  I&#x27;m just that way, because I can use the dollars for other things.  When EV or other options get in the ballpark, or I can get used vehicles, I may well switch over for a lot of reasons.  Won&#x27;t be buying new though.  I will modify, or get used and go from there when it makes sense.  New vehicles make so damn little sense when it&#x27;s just about transport.  (driving experiences, status, pleasure all that are not to be dismissed!  Just not a priority for me at all right now.)<p>I see it as a little glimpse into the not so distant future.  And where there are options, it&#x27;s gonna get more complicated, but the planet will likely benefit, and people will likely be able to find something that works for them better than gas eventually will not work so well for them.<p>It&#x27;s just early man.  :D",,ddingus,,1548140960,2019-01-22T07:09:20Z,comment,18966564,18966472,,,

,,"&#62; I'd be more interested in reading on well-rehearsed, current predictions about Java.<p>I predict Java-the-language will stick around for at least another decade, if not for the huge enterprise codebases and the years invested in Java training, it would be because of Android. The biggest mobile platform of the moment is Android, and it's completely focussed on Java (whether that's a good thing is a whole different discussion).<p>Without Android, I think Java-the-language would fade very quickly, because IMO you can't possible assert the language is better in any way, for any kind of purpose, compared to the many alternatives.

,,"tldr: gamify your development process and jobify your gaming process. Get good feedback loops going for your programming so you can track progress. Count how much money you are earning for every hour of gaming.<p>Why is gaming more fun than programming? In my opinion, it’s because of 3 reasons:<p>1. The action-effect feedback cycle is almost instantaneous<p>2. Your long-term goals are well defined and easy to hold in your active memory(gear, skill spec, kill this boss etc)<p>3. The connection between those goals and your immediate actions is very clear. If you need 200k DPS to farm act whatever and you are at 180k then you need to find such and such item with such and such specs and the optimal farming route for your level is this one so let’s get this shit done!<p>A well designed computer game is like a Waterfall project manager’s wet dream. End outcome is very clear(farm level X in Y minutes), the process of getting there is well described(guides, almost all game variables are numerical and their interactions are simple to model), and the acceptance test is obvious(I am farming level X in Y minutes, or I am too slow or I am plain dying and&#x2F;or not doing enough damage).<p>I think you need to bring your development process and gaming closer together.<p>In terms of the feedback loop use tests and todos. If your tests are failing you know you’re not done, if your todos are falling behind, you know you’re not done. Have some automated performance&#x2F;acceptance tests, I find seeing simulated user behavior being successful as much more satisfying than internal unit stuff. This is likely what you do anyway, so the problem is probably at the long-term level:<p>Do you have a clear outcome in mind? Do you have a clear path to that outcome? Is what you are doing at a given moment helping you achieve that outcome? Do you have a connection in your mind between delivering your project and achieving your life goals? Is working for yourself really what you want? Will you be happier in 30 days for having written the bit of code you are writing right now?<p>Try and answer those questions based on what you feel about the question not on whether saying you prefer gaming to programming means you are a good or bad person.<p>Plan more! Connect your day-to-day coding to your project’s big picture. Make a list of features&#x2F;tasks that are left to do before a project is ‘done’ and go over it every day before and after you start the day. What did you cross off that day? Where has progress been made? How much work is left over? Does the overall plan need to be adjusted?<p>Finally, reprogram your view of gaming. Every time you accomplish something in a game write down this: ‘Today I managed to get a 12 win in Hearthstone with a Mage deck. I earned 300 gold, a card pack with a Leroy and some junk in it, and $0. I predict that this will contribute to me earning $0 going forward.’ Money isn’t everything, but it’s not nothing either.<p>Do the same for programming tasks. Make a note every time you do git commits, for instance. Every little task will STILL be worth $0 immediately, but the end will be different: ‘I wrote the authentication module for my new project, fixing a security issue with token-based auth. I improved the speed at which users get past the login process by 30%(.65 seconds) and it’ll be easy to move the module to a mobile back-end API later on. I predict that this will contribute to me earning $nice_chunk_of_money going forward.’<p>At the most fundamental level there is one difference between casual gaming and programming: human beings value one of those activities enough to transfer some of their resources to you in exchange for having you help them. The other one makes it obvious when you level up.<p>Source: this is how I got through college and got myself to actually improve and use my programming skills.

,,"Hello there,<p>Kindly I address you and sincerely this is not intended as spam or self promoting but a sincere invitation to all and my passion like all free minded individuals like a lot of you no doubt learned &amp; clearly enlightened individuals to share with those that believe in the same ideals and in the process help you make a mega fortune up to 1000% returns or more in 5 years with options to withdraw earnings monthly or yearly which you can do anonymously too I want to introduce you to Bitcoin Private Bank &amp; Blaze Power Corporation. Lets put this in perspective. If you deposit 1BTC today with Bitcoin Private Bank you are guaranteed to earn 16.67% interest every month this is guaranteed regardless of market conditions this is the banks base  interest rate you will always get this no matter what which is better than keeping Bitcoin in a non interest bearing Bitcoin wallet this revenue can also help you mitigate the ever increasing Bitcoin transfer fees &amp; constant rate fluctuations it is also safer than cold storage because the bank stands guarantor for your funds (better than FDIC). Cold storage is not entirely safe because you can lose or corrupt the hardware, key store even a paper wallet can be lost or stolen cold storage is not a fool proof solution (read on it gets better). But for the more ambitious individual there is even greater reward when you invest rather than just banking &amp; I will elaborate. Looking at Blaze Power market share 100% (there is no direct competitor i.e based on rate of production &amp; service revenue from wholesale discounted power supply). The actual growth rate of Blaze Power Corporation is thus in excess of this, 1BTC investment in Blaze Power Corporation today would net you $3,000,000.00 in 5 years, that is $50,000.00 earned every month for a 1BTC investment this is not theory or speculation, ponzi or a pyramid but based on actual performance &amp; energy market fundamentals. Obviously like any other IPO (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft including early days of Bitcoin etc) the trick is to buy as many shares as you can then watch the value of your shares grow as the company expands rapidly &amp; watch yourself go from Bitcoin to Millionaire in a short space of time. Impossible? Well unlike Facebook, Google, Twitter or Microsoft we actually have a world changing tangible product worth trillions &amp; a life critical &amp; essential service (Unlimited Electricity which ironically is also the backbone of all Bitcoin mining, the major overhead &amp; determines the difference between break even or bankruptcy in Bitcoin mining thus how can you go wrong?). What or who is Blaze Power Corporation? Well I will elaborate. I am CEO of Blaze Power Corporation. My company is here <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blaze-power.eu"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blaze-power.eu</a> and just like Germany we have a big drive toward the eradication of the Nuclear danger &amp; threat. We have created a revolutionary new way to create power without nuclear waste or hot fission radioactive reaction. We have invented reactive power reactor or Fueless Energy Acquisition Reactor &quot;FEAR Tech™&quot; as we acronym it (see the website) worth untold billions even trillions of EUR&#x2F;GBP&#x2F;USD whichever you prefer. You can invest in this marvelous technology with Bitcoin (or regular Bank Transfers if anonymity is of no concern to you) through a Bitcoin offshore investment bank <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitcoin-bank.trade"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitcoin-bank.trade</a> to also help raise awareness in the future of Green Energy, privacy which are all under threat. DO NOT take my word for it just read the Testimonials &amp; see what existing clients have to say. To put this into perspective (see Bitcoin Bank) for every 1BTC you invest today you are guaranteed to have more than $30million USD in share value alone within 5 years if of course you do not sell your shares this is factoring in the rate of growth of Blaze Power Technology thus for every 1BTC or more you invest now you are a guaranteed millionaire in 5 years. Checkout both websites and have an open mind do not miss out like those caught sleeping in the early days of Microsoft when people laughed at Bill Gates when he stated that software would outsell hardware when it comes to computing, this then is one of those moments thus this is the time to get in your chance, it&#x27;s not too late. Spread the word and let us make a difference business wise &amp; conscious. Visit YouTube and keyword FUKUSHIMA danger 2016 you are also saving the world &amp; making a big difference. You are not safe as long as Nuclear reactors still exist this is your chance to make a mega profit &amp; save the world at the same time. Before you get skeptical take a look at what famous individuals in history said (as pointed out by a savvy investor at Bitcoin Bank) and quote:<p>“The horse is here to stay, but automobiles are only a novelty, a fad.” Horace Rackham, 1903<p>“Rock &amp; Roll will be gone by June” Variety Magazine 1955<p>“Remote shopping while entirely feasible will flop” Time Magazine 1968<p>“Television will not last. It is a flash in the pan.” Mary Summerville 1948<p>“Next Christmas, the I-Pod will be dead, finished, gone, kaput.” Alan Sugar 2005<p>“There is no likelihood man can tap the power of the atom.” Robert Millikan, 1923<p>“The telephone has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication.” William Horton 1876<p>“I predict the internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.” Robert Metcalf 1995<p>“The cinema is little more than a fad.” Charlie Chaplin 1916<p>“The idea that calvarly will be replaced with these iron coaches is absurd.” Field Marchsall Haig, 1916 talking about the tank<p>“Fooling around with alternating current is just a waste of time. No one will ever use it.” Thomas Edison 1889<p>“I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.” — Thomas
Watson, chairman of IBM, 1943.<p>“There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home.” — Ken Olson, president, chairman and founder of Digital Equipment Corp., 1977.<p>PS*: An idea? Buy one of our Free Electricity Generators &amp; use them to power your rigs &amp; mine Bitcoin for free. We have the power!

Which means that my neighborhood is excessively cheap given the low demand. I&#x27;ve paid $14 for what would cost $35 in a taxi.<p>When Uber stops subsidizing this, it means that fewer people will use it and fewer cars will be in the area. That means drivers would have to drive an extra 10-15 minutes to get to me. That&#x27;s a lot of driving time without getting paid, and drivers don&#x27;t like that. That&#x27;s why taxis <i>never</i> came to my house, pre-Uber.<p>It still doesn&#x27;t make sense at higher prices. Pre-Uber, I would pay limo services $60-$100 just to ensure someone showed up.

,,I predict that at some point some of these highly outsourced companies will face competition from a former internal &quot;contracting&quot; company (or sets of them) that have been doing substantial portions of the direct work.<p>If a company has fewer and fewer essential &quot;walls&quot; separating what they do at the core vs a possible competitor the risk goes up. If one categorizes a peripheral competency as something that should have been in-house then the company becomes at risk of getting quickly subsumed by a competition hiring contractors that the prime company originally trained. And it might not show up for a while unless some assumption shifts - in the meantime the short term profits might look pretty good.<p>Another risk might be the collapse or disruption at a contracted company where you have less control.,,dv_dt,,1533147916,2018-08-01T18:25:16Z,comment,17665390,17664948,,,

The whole &quot;super-delegate&quot; thing was deliberately designed to make sure that party &quot;elders&quot; could influence the choice of nominee, so that the party base would not again nominate someone who was unelectable.

,,"(This reply may come across as harsh. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re bad or dumb for your views. I think you haven&#x27;t a chance to experience some of this stuff from the inside so you&#x27;re making reasonable guesses about what&#x27;s going on, and some of those guesses are understandably limited because you don&#x27;t have direct experience with the issue.)<p>---<p>This is a pretty patronizing view. You led with an intention to get &quot;the whole story,&quot; but you only went one step further. I&#x27;d like to take it another step or two further than that:<p>&gt; you only need to borrow if you don&#x27;t have money. &gt; you can only save if you have money.<p>&gt;&gt; Certainly more income makes these easier. But consider the following impossible-to-conduct-in-reality-experiment: Set group A to be a set of 100 randomly selected poor folks who are only qualified to be cashiers or stock shelves. As group B, select a random set of people who currently earn 6-figure salaries and doom them to only ever work the same class of jobs as group A for the rest of their lives. I would not be surprised to find that the formerly wealthy would, in general, borrow less and save more.<p>I very much doubt they would--that group is used to saving more, yes, but they are also used to spending more, in absolute terms, than the poor who are not saving. Old habits die hard?<p>But actually since it&#x27;s not possible to know what the results would be, I&#x27;d like to assume you&#x27;re correct about the hypothetical results, and further point out that the proclivity to borrow and not to save may be adaptive. Middle class+ people obviously do better when they save, but I&#x27;d be surprised if that were true for most of the poor.<p>The marginal value of each dollar is still quite high when a person makes minimum wage, so it&#x27;s a big stretch to save, say, $100 per month. After a year of saving at that rate you&#x27;ll have approximately $1,200.<p>First of all, it&#x27;s worth noting that saving $100 month consistently is super unlikely just on the basis of stability of employment. At this level, jobs and hours are unpredictable. But let&#x27;s say that somehow you have a unicorn job that pays you a consistently $1100 a month (don&#x27;t short your hours, or fire you without notice, isn&#x27;t seasonal, whatever).<p>Next, consider that in this unlikely scenario where you have consistent income and can live off only $1,000&#x2F;mo, then at the end of the year you&#x27;ve saved $1,200. My daughter recently went to the dentist, her bill was around $2,000. I&#x27;ve gotten bills higher than $1,200 for car repair. Heaven forbid an ER visit that year--$1,200 would be a tiny fraction of that bill.<p>So now we&#x27;re in a world where not only do we posit super unusual job stability, but also no emergencies happening or major expenses coming up (eg. never having to move). Back of the napkin, assuming the market doesn&#x27;t tank at some point, someone doing this impossible thing would save about $38,000 in 30 years. That&#x27;s enough for about 3 years of living expenses at their poverty level, $1,000 per month.<p>The reality is that they would never be able to save such an exorbitant amount.<p>The reality is that bills and emergencies do come up, and that&#x27;s what puts poor people in the hole. And when you receive that $9,000 ER bill it doesn&#x27;t make a damn bit of difference whether you had that $1,200 saved or whether you bought a flat screen with it, you&#x27;re still deep in debt probably forever (or whatever, the 7.5 years it takes for the debt to fall off). Except it&#x27;s obviously better to be fucked while you have a flat screen, instead of identically fucked without a flat screen.<p>The calculus here is that you are going to end up in an unrecoverable financial hole on a regular basis no matter what you do, so when you have some cash you spend it before the system takes it from you. I&#x27;m not so sure that way of thinking is wrong for those people.<p>On top of all that, many assistance programs aimed at the poor penalize you for savings, ie. if you have X savings you can&#x27;t qualify for the assistance. But if you have a flatscreen and no savings you _can_ qualify.<p>All this can be true even if it&#x27;s also true that saving is a good idea for middle class+ people.<p>&gt; healthy food costs more than unhealthy food.<p>&gt;&gt; While an optimal diet does certainly cost more than a calorically-equivalent amount of cheetos, you can shop at walmart - buying only eggs, oatmeal, and bananas - with the probable result that your diet will be both healthier and cheaper than those of most low-income families.<p>I object generally to arguments in the shape of &quot;if they just do something heroic and clever it&#x27;ll be fine.&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s assume generously that all people have the same basic time, energy, education, etc constraints around food. And let&#x27;s further assume that the default outcome for middle class+ people is that that&#x27;s fine because the money they have to spend on the problem buys basically fine food. So obviously the default outcome for poor people is not fine because the money they have to spend on the problem can only buy bad food that hurts them.<p>It&#x27;s not ok with me on a systematic level to say to an entire population: this system is set up in a way that doesn&#x27;t work for you through no fault of your own. All you have to do to route around that is educate yourself unrealistically, overcome ubiquitous social and media pressure, and put in special effort, time, and energy, and you&#x27;ll be able to have food that is adequate nutritionally, barely. Probably.<p>Can an individual put in heroic effort to overcome systemic issues for themselves? Sure. Is that the last word in a conversation about systemic issues? Absolutely not.<p>&gt; good attire costs money.<p>&gt;&gt; Maybe so, but anyone can get a dress shirt&#x2F;jacket&#x2F;slacks at a thrift store for probably less than $30 all told. It won&#x27;t be high-end clothing, but will at least look professional.<p>Clothing is like accents--they mark your class pretty solidly. The thing is that if you grow up speaking a certain way, it&#x27;s pretty hard to change your accent. Clothing is the same way. Your concept of what &quot;professional&quot; clothing looks like comes from a deeply ingrained cultural intuition. And for what it&#x27;s worth, anyone with that cultural intuition can spot clothing in the uncanny valley of &quot;trying to look professional, but obviously bought these clothes at a thrift shop&quot; in a heartbeat.<p>I am a privileged white professional with this intuition and I promise that I would leave a Saks Fifth looking way more &quot;professional&quot; than I would leave a thrift store looking, even if I had an unlimited thrift store budget.<p>If your answer to this is for individuals to put in special effort to be unrealistically enculturated such they somehow have the intuition for it, plus heroically willing to spend extra time and effort locating clothing that&#x27;s both cheap and nails the signaling, then see my rebuttal above.<p>&gt; based on whether they sound like something a poor person would write.<p>&gt;&gt; Idk about this one. What would a poor person write? Is this just a matter of whether they have good grammar? Nobody (almost nobody?) is conspiring to keep the poor stuck where they are. I don&#x27;t think anyone would reject a qualified applicant just because they have no money.<p>This is maybe the most interesting response you made because the point seems to have bounced off you entirely. The person you&#x27;re replying to is making a point about signaling social class. It&#x27;s about our perspective from the lofty heights of privilege feeling from the inside like we can tell quality or lack thereof, when the reality is that it isn&#x27;t about quality per se, but about signaling class. And in fact what we&#x27;re calling a spectrum of &quot;professional presentation ability&quot; can just as readily be labeled by its opposite: &quot;how poor this person sounds.&quot; That&#x27;s not a fact about the universe, it&#x27;s a fact about our culture.<p>If that doesn&#x27;t make sense, I&#x27;m not surprised. Pretend like I just told you something profound, and sleep on it. If it clicks, I predict this whole thread will make a lot more sense to you.",,pmichaud,,1465249779,2016-06-06T21:49:39Z,comment,11850699,11849874,,,

,,"So the time value of money is more or less zero now and loan rates depend much more on default risk than any opportunity cost in loaning the money. To an economist, the implications of that might be big, but to a regular person, it&#x27;s really a small shift in possibilities.<p>A savings account at 0% doesn&#x27;t build wealth, but it didn&#x27;t really do that 3 months ago at 1.5%. Personal loans at 9% aren&#x27;t much better than loans at 11%.<p>If you&#x27;re not planning on making a career out of doing something finance-related, I&#x27;d say there isn&#x27;t much to do differently.<p>My one recommendation would be to hedge a little against the possibility of asset bubbles.

As an example, everyone in this life needs a roof over their head, so if you don&#x27;t own anything real estate related, a bubble in real estate prices is a risk. A homeowner who plans to stay in their house 20 more years doesn&#x27;t have to care about annual changes in the real estate market...but a renter does. So own your home if it makes sense for your situation, or consider having money in REITs, or own a rental property. Don&#x27;t over-extend yourself, but try to avoid needing a tulip and not having one in 1636.<p>Likewise, if you are relying on investments to retire, and are many years away from doing so, make sure a significant portion is in boring sp500&#x2F;total stock market etfs. If your time horizon is long enough, not being able to buy stocks at a decent price is a bigger threat to your retirement than a short term drop, so make sure you have some amount of money in the market while the market isn&#x27;t at all time highs.<p>As always, it depends on your situation and I&#x27;m not qualified to tell you what to do with your finances.",,mrfredward,,1585668131,2020-03-31T15:22:11Z,comment,22738370,22737423,,,

But (admittedly, anecdotally) everyone I talk to seems to use Dropbox. Personally, I use it on all of my devices.<p>I also use Box for business-related storage, and Google Drive for presentations, documents, etc. I use Amazon Prime Photos to store my photo roll. I don&#x27;t think that any of those detract from Dropbox&#x27;s primary use case of sharing files between different machines.

You have to remember that it&#x27;s not just corporate use that caused the Dropbox ban -- your sysadmins also don&#x27;t want people putting work documents in Dropbox to work on from home, because <i>so many</i> people already use Dropbox in their personal lives. The fact that your organization blocked Dropbox, instead of just saying &quot;we use Google Drive,&quot; speaks to the fact that so many people are already happy Dropbox users and would just as soon continue to use it.<p>That said, I agree with you wholeheartedly that Dropbox, if going for major corporate adoption, will fail in its endeavor. I don&#x27;t think that Google Drive is the primary competitor -- in my opinion, it&#x27;s Box. Yes, you have to actually pay for Box, but in many corporate environments, that&#x27;s not really much of an issue.<p>Said another way, I predict Dropbox failing in a corporate environment for the same reason they will continue to succeed with personal users: businesses want &quot;cloud storage,&quot; and personal users want &quot;easy file share with myself.&quot;<p>Maybe I&#x27;ll look back on this comment in a few years and see that I was dead wrong, but for now that&#x27;s where I&#x27;d put my money.",,david_shaw,,1454522904,2016-02-03T18:08:24Z,comment,11028211,11027970,,,

After decades of a vicious cycle of procrastination and depression my ability to perform at an adequate level was entirely gone.

Fortunately (or unfortunately) I lucked out by joining a team that was set up to enable this to continue.<p>After almost 10 years on the team and some treatment for the anxiety I realized that I was performing at less than 10% of my comfortable capacity.

I spoke with my manager and confirmed that he believed all of this and that, amazingly, he was actively moderating the amount of work sent my way because he was convinced I was overworked.<p>I had a sudden crisis because this meant that, as an entire team, we had trained ourselves to ignore how poor of a job we have been doing.

,,"&gt; My bet is always-on broadband. Virtual worlds, digital entertainment, gaming …. None of it would be possible without broadband. Today, we have about 100-250 Mbps in most modern homes. In some places, you can get a gigabit per second. Now imagine what we could do if, in ten years, we all have 10 gigabits per second in our homes, and we have in-home networks that are fast and fat.<p>Hmm. Kind of an interesting take. I predict the opposite. I think we have hit the diminishing returns on bandwidth. People don&#x27;t even know what to do with residential internet in the 100mbps. We can stream HD video (both up and down)...what else is there. If there are no applications straining at bandwidth limits now, im not sure improving them will make new products. If anything i think the best gains are going to be in latency and in mobile bandwidth. Cheap high speed, no data cap, internet for cell phones would be pretty great. But still i&#x27;d consider that incremental. I think its unlikely the next big technology enabler will be the same as the last one.<p>&gt; In 2001, we imagined a 100 Mbps future — and we got Google, a nearly trillion-dollar company.<p>Google was founded in 1998, and that was still the dial-up era.

Yahoo should have developed the Super Awesome Browser 9000 (even if they used a previously unknown browser as a starting point -- Opera doesn&#x27;t count) instead of just slapping some branding on one of the most popular and famous browsers.

One thing you learn from this is how frequently your attention wanders, and by really training yourself to focus you learn how your attention is directed from moment to moment.

Click around that website if you want to learn her views on any particular topic. The relevant ideas here, though, are her views on concepts. There&#x27;s been a long-running divide in philosophy between people who thought concepts reflected something intrinsic to the universe (e.g., that all horses contain an essence of horse-ness, or reflect Plato&#x27;s ideal horse) -- and the people who thought this was nonsense and that language was therefore an arbitrary human construct (this latter view is currently dominant). Rand found a third position: concepts are human constructs, but they serve an objective purpose, and there are objective rules which determine their formation. ITOE is the only place where you will find her full argument.<p>To compare the two: Buddha takes sensory experience as the gold standard for reality, and concludes that reality exists, but is ultimately transient and lacks identity. Rand takes perceptual experience as the gold standard and concludes that reality exists, that the everyday objects we perceive really exist, and that therefore reality is logical and consistent.<p>(As for Wittgenstein, he says human language is just an arbitrary game which can never describe true reality, and ends up in a kind of quasi-mysticism (man helpless in the face of an ineffable, incomprehensible universe)).<p>I predict you will not be satisfied with this answer, because you are following a very misleading philosophical framework, but I wrote it up for the interest of lurkers.",,IsaacL,,1479991846,2016-11-24T12:50:46Z,comment,13030045,13027094,,,

Thanks for the uservoice tickets (btw, uservoice is really awesome). This is great feedback thanks a lot.<p>* I&#x27;ll definitely provide more info on what happens after group play. We say in the rules that &quot;Predictions can be submitted at any time before the official start time of the concerned game&quot;, and this is true for all the games, including those in the knockouts. We thought that the knockout rounds would be extremely boring if your predictions are already set with the wrong teams. And you already got penalized for making the bad predictions in the group play. So we took the decision to open the knockout for predictions only when the teams are known, as it seemed to us that it would preserve the fun until very late in the competition.<p>* regarding the score inputs, actually I think this really depends on people. with my friends we wanted this level of details because it makes it more fun to us. To use your example, if I predict 4-0, you predict 4-1, and the actual score is 4-1, you will earn a few more points than me.",,edelans,,1402450020,2014-06-11T01:27:00Z,comment,7876180,7874021,,,

In the last 18 months I&#x27;ve gotten two promotions, including one four months after I started which is unheard of in state service (and which my bosses had to fight HR to get). I spearheaded the acquisition and implemented of a version control system, which no one hear had ever used (they were just FTPing files all the time, risking overwriting of others&#x27; work etc), and got buy-in from all the developers who now say they couldn&#x27;t imagine working without it.

How will the user handle more advanced use cases?<p>* Option 2: Vendor managed (Currently the most likely): The devices will talk to the vendor servers which will talk to other vendor servers which will talk to your other devices. Terrible for the user for so many reasons but great for the vendor: its the simplest to implement, keeps protocols secret and locks user into giving that specific vendor endpoint all that juicy data.<p>* Option 3: User managed (IMHO Preferable): Computer drivers are a much better model for this. Drivers sit over devices to transform the weird device API (fixed target) into a consistent interop API (community driven moving target) that does what people want. This still supports device-to-device: device A -&gt; API call on gateway driver A -&gt; gw driver interop API -&gt; API call gateway driver B -&gt; device B.

It's about <i>control</i>.<p>Once you implement OpenID logins, the security, reliability, and confidentiality of your site's authentication procedure is out of your hands.

You're adding moving parts to your system, decreasing your reliability and increasing your tech-support costs, and for what? The alternative -- using usernames and passwords -- is well understood, and well established, and is something that you'll have to support <i>anyway</i> for the foreseeable future. How much additional money is OpenID <i>really</i> going to bring in?<p>If OpenID does become widespread I predict that it will be in the form of a handful of ""trusted"" providers whose IDs are universally supported. On most sites, you'll get to choose between using your Facebook ID, your Google ID, your Microsoft ID, your Verisign ID, and an ID from the site's trusted network of partners.

,,"Thanks for the support. Feel free to mail me.<p>The current avenue of approach is indeed in two System Parts:<p>(1) Definition of the problem: If we want things to be &#x27;best&#x27; in a sense, &#x27;maximally humane&#x27;, &#x27;maximum quality of experience&#x27;, &#x27;maximum quality of life, existence and culture&#x27;, etc. we should define those things, and create structures that continually refine and employ the best methods to asses and measure progress.<p>(2) Optimization of the problem: Choosing the architecture and structures that maximizes our measures. This again almost certainly is some kind of distributed structure that gives rewards and occasionally demands compensation (for a generalization of negative externality -- generalized externality of existence).<p>I often say that the Universe is a search problem. This is just a big honkin&#x27; search problem :)<p>---<p>Capitalism leaves the job of (1) on the individual, and on the government somewhat. The job of (2) is accomplished by a dual again of capital (supply and demand, allocation of capital for maximum profit) and government (using taxes and incentives). Again the problem of capitalism is that it doesn&#x27;t account for externalities very well (too often ends up maximizing the wrong function), and the problem of government is inefficiency, centralization (algorithmic inefficiency of resource allocation strategies), lack of agility.<p>Note: Capitalism (without support structures) is very similar to evolutionary dynamics. It&#x27;s hard to model exactly what evolutionary dynamics maximizes, but one formulation is that it maximizes environmental domination: expanding to cover the most of the environment, whatever it takes. Lose consciousness and become soul-less robots to take over everything? Sure, no problem; and annihilate anything that gets in the way. Accidentally or not evolutionary dynamics gave us life and consciousness, but it&#x27;s not certain life and consciousness will endure as essential for environmental domination (in a way, consciousness is currently related to intelligence via humans, but we for example already appear able to create super-human intelligence that is not conscious or at least not very conscious). So we need to change the objective function to create a great harmonious future where some for of existence... exists.<p>To see why evolutionary dynamics and environmental stability (i.e. the result of environmental expansion) doesn&#x27;t prize conscious experience (in general, the Meaning of life), I use two thought experiments:<p>(1) Generalized grey goo&#x2F;Paperclip maximizer. Again, just picture a very intelligent creature dedicated to maximizing only its environmental domination. It will create other forms of intelligence only as much as needed to maintain its dominion. Any form of existence that&#x27;s not immediately conductive to the maintenance and expansion of dominion is irrelevant&#x2F;negative value. I can only see this leading to an empty Universe and a few singular intelligences looking for ways to annihilate all other existences at maximum speed focusing on weapons research and planetary domination exclusively.<p>(2) Doomsday button. The ultimate thought experiment in this line is the following: suppose you assume environmental regularization (domination) originated by your actions is the &#x27;Ideal goal of existence&#x27;. Then I present you a doomsday button: If you push the button, you will trigger some kind of physical mechanism that will consume the entire universe into a regular lifeless crystal-like structure. Think of it as a bomb of expanding regular wave that takes over the entire universe. In a way, this represents a maximally stable solution to dominating the environment... maximum effect, perpetual and irreversible. But that doesn&#x27;t look like a good solution at all, does it? It&#x27;s in fact lifeless and non-existential.<p>Clearly the ultimate objective is related to existence, not to environmental domination or regularization by some abstract definition of &#x27;Individual&#x27; or &#x27;Nation&#x27; or whatever. If we can&#x27;t change objective, I predict we&#x27;ll be consumed by this savage nature quite soon.<p>---<p>I don&#x27;t mean to trivialize System Part 1 (Evaluation). It&#x27;s literally all that matters to humanity and existence. I guarantee it&#x27;s not a second degree equation :) For example, individual autonomy can be an important component of human experience, the ability and free will to decide more or less independently is likely an important part of the whole.<p>My approach is that we need to define the Meaning of life clearly. We&#x27;ve also postponed this way too much as a Civilization. By now it shouldn&#x27;t be <i>that</i> complicated -- we know it&#x27;s got to do with experience and somehow the internal dynamics of a large neural network, the sustainability and continuity of life. I have a draft[1] but don&#x27;t expect it to be bulletproof. This should evolve into a Formalization of Ethics program (hopefully a collaborative, worldwide effort) to get the basics done. Think of it as a Super Declaration of Human rights, or a Foundation of Ethics (like we have a Foundation of Mathematics).<p>This could not be ignored by any nation, hopefully in the short term strengthening clarity and convictions on the objective of human (and generalized conscious) existence.<p>This Foundations <i>should</i> be Universal.<p>First, I&#x27;m convinced the rough draft (given above) is correct, it should be a matter of truth and reason[2], and not require any advanced metaphysics or elicit genuine controversy after rational examination. This is also part of a new propostion for making philosophy that I call &#x27;Explosive Philosophy&#x27;: the negation of the Principle of Experience (i.e. consciousness is not the prime motive of existence) leads to absurdity as demonstrated by several thought experiments. Explosive Philosophy is the use of rejection by absurd by taking particularly obviously unacceptable consequences of a principle.<p>Second, if some Nation is a Competitive Supremacist (i.e. Evolutionarist), that will clearly put it in conflict with the Conscious Foundations. It will try to achieve domination at all costs, and eventually it will need to settle with the Foundations[2] or live under constant watch to make sure it doesn&#x27;t take over everything or even consume itself.<p>---<p>Afterwards, the plan is as I insuated, to change the Political-Economic-Cultural system to reflect the universal values (including diversity from derived heuristics). The main idea I&#x27;ve had is to create concrete measures related to Quality of Experience, and a distributed network of evaluations, each specialized in a segment of society (Science, Industry, Culture, Philosophy, etc.) measures impact of Corporations&#x2F;Entities&#x2F;Individuals, and compensates for the error the capitalist system has.<p>So if I create predatory advertisement, this has a social cost. An evaluator can perceive this, measure it (estimate it), and demand compensation (to be given back to society). The evaluator itself takes a share of this compensation to reward its effort. The evaluator can even colaborate with the company to more acurately measure the externality, and reduce the compensation (under uncertainty the evaluator would have an adjustment to overestimate&#x2F;take an upper bound of the evaluation).<p>Those evaluator are adversarially cooperative, and predictive, in the sense that they oversee themselves as well, and are predictive. The success of an evaluator is asessed later: a market is established for the correctness of the decision.<p>The idea is to replace Supply-and-Demand with Science: in particular, a kind of Eventual Consensus -- in simple terms, the Consensus of evaluation by relevant audience&#x2F;specialists upon reflection after a long time. The Consensus is made through cross-evaluation of evaluators (they get funds based on the later re-evaluation by the wider evaluation network), as well as certain input from individuals, corporations and government. Transparent (and relatively simple) algorithms resolve the credit assignment problem of how each evaluator should be credited. This is similar to the slow eventual consensus of Science, although the goals are different and the system would be both simpler and more transparent. That&#x27;s close to a definition of truth itself: the eventual consensus model revealed by experiments and sufficient formal reasoning (following axioms of logic, and axiom of reality).<p>I call this idea &#x27;Elementalism&#x27; for now.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;EffectiveAltruism&#x2F;comments&#x2F;p2w4ql&#x2F;extinction_sounds_bad_but_given_the_sheer_amount&#x2F;h8p3ou6&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;EffectiveAltruism&#x2F;comments&#x2F;p2w4ql&#x2F;e...</a><p>[2] Any similarity with Asimov&#x27;s Foundations is a mere coincidence? :)<p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;slatestarcodex&#x2F;comments&#x2F;p6ng5d&#x2F;what_are_some_high_quality_blogsforumspeople_that&#x2F;h9f0t2i&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;slatestarcodex&#x2F;comments&#x2F;p6ng5d&#x2F;what...</a><p>Note: What I mean by experience is not any kind of pure hedonism.

The pipe is going to be owned by the RBOCs. Pac Bell and all those guys are going to provide cheap ISDN lines into the home that come with a little box that turns it into Ethernet, and they are going to be impossible to compete with. But, as we’ve been talking about, the new Web set-up is just like the mainframe computing model, where all the apps will run off the server, and these will mostly be custom apps.</i><p>Microsoft tried and very nearly succeeded in replacing the open web with the ActiveX &quot;information superhighway&quot;.

,,"The first opportunity to comment on bioinformatics since my non-compete&#x2F;nda is over!<p>This seems like a very sloppily put together list of <i>myths</i>, but I&#x27;ll bite anyway.<p>1. Not true, but I think that&#x27;s largely because much of the software used is closed so the FOSS community is largely anemic in the bio world. For the tools that are FOSS or BSD, I saw plenty of contributions, but the other thing to keep in mind is that it&#x27;s not just about the programming. You have to have a certain level of understanding of the application domain to program a solution for it properly, and there are very few of these people around. I predict a huge uptick in demand and salaries for bioprogrammers.<p>2. Is true. You need your own people on salary to program for your needs. I was the sysadmin part of a phd, sysadmin, programmer team and we were doing stuff that no-one else was going to do for us. You need to have your own programmer, and a good sysadmin, full stop.<p>3. Is also true. Picking the right license is important because many labs are pretty tight on cash flow. Sure, they probably have millions going through them a month, but operating costs are super high and margins are lower than you may think. It was during my time in the genetics lab that I fully realized why FOSS was so important, and I think it&#x27;s the future. (with a few key proprietary exceptions that no FOSS has matched yet, (think Elmer vs Comsol))<p>4. Using a FOSS license makes this a moot point to address. Use GPLv3 code people, stop using BSD!<p>5-9: not worth addressing.<p>Anyway, my overall view of the field is this: with sequencing getting cheaper, the problem is in managing the levels of data being generated (sysadmin issue) and in interpreting the data for meaningful results (programmer&#x2F;phd issue). Personally, I think that machine learning is going to be the right breakthrough to follow and apply to bio, and once we do that I expect it to take off to crazy levels. I&#x27;m talking sequencer in every doctors office, and artificial genetic manipulation becoming much easier and with more accurate predictions.<p>Also, the other thing everyone underestimates is the microbiome as an entity.

,,"I haven't used the buildpack, but based on working with Parse and watching the screencast, here are some guesses:<p>1) Parse is more full-featured. Parse includes significant automatic support for things like modeling users, comes with UI components for e.g. sign up, and includes e.g. a UITableViewController subclass to automatically support things like automatic paging.<p>2) While Parse's documentation is superb, these features come at the cost of flexibility (though you don't have to use all of them, of course -- it could just be a REST backend if you wanted it to be, like the heroku buildpack seen here). You'll tie your iOS app to Parse with PFObjects, whereas you're much more flexible with a backend agnostic approach that you'll get just using a REST web service.<p>3) The Heroku buildpack will probably tie better to CoreData. There might be a clean approach for this with Parse (when I used it I was pretty new to iOS) but I ended up having PFObject and Core Data representations of objects, which is rather clunky. Conversely, if you aren't using Core Data, this build pack wouldn't be helpful for you.<p>Some conclusions: 1) people who are learning to write iOS apps and don't have experience writing a web server should probably use Parse because it will be easier. It is my suspicion, as a few others have commented, that you will run into problems like ""Oh, how should I deal with user accounts and passwords"" that Parse will handle, but you'll have to figure out if using the buildpack. The buildpack comes with all the advantages you'd associate with Heroku -- other people know what those are better than me.<p>Let me also say that Mattt Thompson is an inspiration (check out his github and NSHipster.com, which are fantastic and foreshadowed this project) and I predict this buildpack will be as awesome as he can make it.",,MaxGabriel,,1353358618,2012-11-19T20:56:58Z,comment,4806332,4805646,,,

,,"The reason we can't drop the article into a computer and have it magically return ""true"" or ""false"" is because making computers that even have human intelligence is <i>damn</i> hard as it is, so until we can perfect language parsing and the like and then input millennia of collective mathematical knowledge (correctly, no less), we're not going to have any particular progress on that front.<p>What does this have to do with ""flaws"" in contemporary mathematics though? If you're trying to use this as an example of a flaw in anything, it would be the computer industry for not figuring out artificial intelligence, not the mathematics community. So, <i>if</i> this was the author's intention, then I think it's flawed right from the outset, but I don't think this was truly the author's intent. (For one thing, Curry-Howard correspondence is talking about lambda calculus, not what you think when you hear ""computer"" today.)<p>Really, the article's entire premise is predicated on <i>extreme</i> misunderstandings of Godel. For instance:<p>&#62; In fact, Gödel's 1931 Second Incompleteness Theorem insists that it is strictly forbidden to ever claim the truth of any scientific or mathematical statement:<p>What? Where does it say that? It says (quoting the article here):<p>&#62; For any formal effectively generated theory T including basic arithmetical truths and also certain truths about formal provability, if T includes a statement of its own consistency then T is inconsistent.<p>If a theory includes a statement of its own consistency, then that theory is inconsistent. How does that imply that it is ""strictly forbidden to ever claim the truth of any scientific or mathematical statement""? The honest answer is that it doesn't, not in the slightest. When it comes to mathematics, we're not saying the axioms are consistent, we're saying statements <i>within this set of axioms</i> are true. Are the axiomizations true? I don't know, but <i>a lot</i> of work has gone into these theories and so far they look pretty good. But at any rate, the author uses this theorem in a completely incorrect manner. He is right that we don't know if any of the various mathematical foundations are consistent, true, but as I said, so far everything looks pretty good.<p>Then he throws this bombshell:<p>&#62; Given Gödel's First Incompleteness we already know that for any claim making use of basic arithmetic, counterexamples must exist.<p>What? How? Here's Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem, per Wikipedia:<p>&#62; Any effectively generated theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both consistent and complete. In particular, for any consistent, effectively generated formal theory that proves certain basic arithmetic truths, there is an arithmetical statement that is true, but not provable in the theory (Kleene 1967, p. 250)<p>How in the world does that say that ""for any claim making use of basic arithmetic, counterexamples must exist."" (Counterexamples of what, anyway? Basic arithmetic?) Actually, what the theorem says that you can't have a theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic that is <i>both</i> consistent and complete. The <i>both</i> is the huge part. So far, for example, we think ZFC is consistent. We <i>know</i> it is not complete; see this: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statements_undecidable_in_ZFC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statements_undecidable_...</a> . So, the idea that there ""must exist counterexamples"" (of what, I don't know) as per Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem is simply ridiculous. As a result, we don't know that there are ""simply bugs"" in the ""successor function."" As a result, the idea that ""all basic claims are more or less false"" is completely shot down. Needs better proof.<p>&#62; The claim above is not Popper-compliant.<p>Why not? It's falsifiable, so it is. (If it were false, you would need simply to provide an extremely small epsilon and ask for the correspondingly large delta.) It gives the ""appearance"" of truth because it is indeed true -- relative to the axioms under which it was proven. The author also seems to conflate inductive and deductive disciplines. In mathematics, we create axioms and follow them through to some meaning. In the vast majority of the sciences, the process is very much inductive. So, this seeming focus on making everything mathematical ""scientific"" is pretty flawed in and of itself. How can you reason about mathematics if you don't have some way to check your results? In the sciences, if I predict gravity will disappear in five minutes for thirty seconds, that is a very testable claim (and a false one, most likely, based on our past experimentation). How can I disprove or prove something in mathematics? Well, we created all these wonderful axioms and they seem consistent (although incomplete, of course), so I can use them to check my results. A little PHP script is not going to cut it. For one thing, the author's script's notion of ""division"" is predicated on the very idea of division. Where did that come from? For another, the script is not a proof at all. It's just a program to test some values. It doesn't <i>prove</i> anything at all. It's just further evidence towards the proof of something we already know is true.<p>In sum: the article is bullshit. It misinterprets Godel in terrible ways. For all the fancy French and Latin, it doesn't even provide a programmatic proof of its own claims, the supposed holy grail, after all! The only program it provides is a little test, not anything near a proof. I think if you actually try to provide ""Popper-compliant"" statements and write programs to prove everything, you end up reverting to all of the normal contemporary mathematical language anyway. I mean, look at this:<p>&#62; In order to reject this claim, find a number almostZero for which it will not be possible to find a large enough number x for which 1/x is smaller than almostZero.<p>That sentence is essentially a rewording of an old-fashioned delta-epsilon proof. So, how does that indicate a flaw in contemporary mathematics at all? Why should we stop teaching our kids these ""symbols"" since they are apparently still so very convenient for reasoning about mathematics? The truth is that there's no reason to. The ""executable claims"" are only found after all of the ""verbiage"" is said and done.",,ReidZB,,1356167678,2012-12-22T09:14:38Z,comment,4956205,4956000,,,

Insofar as supernatural claims about God from religious texts can be made sense of, they are inconsistent with physics (or if you prefer, false). This leaves room for a more abstract &quot;God&quot;, or a God-falsified history, but even if we ultimately know the genealogy of the idea, we should consider the possibility.<p>We could say similar things about the simulation hypothesis. It arrives in the information age, at at time when the high-performance computing, The Matrix, and virtual reality are culturally salient. Out of context, the simulation hypothesis looks like just another metaphor&#x2F;myth about the creation of the universe. Proponents of the simulation hypothesis suggest that the proof of the simulation can be found by examining inconsistencies in the universe&#x27;s structure, as if that will eliminate all other improvable explanations. Hint: it doesn&#x27;t, and even if you think it does, you can&#x27;t infer anything about the &quot;real world&quot; without assuming it tracks with the simulation. Again, there is no reason to believe this.<p>Some would say the simulation hypothesis is testable and that this marks an important distinction. But are any conceivable tests specific to simulation, and not generalizable to alternative metaphysical theories or to misunderstood features of the universe? Either way, I predict the simulation hypothesis will live on after the &quot;tests&quot; have failed time, and time again.

It's hard to change fundamentals once you have already publicized a language and you have working code, and I think some of the fundamentals of Arc will definitely need to be changed. In particular, the distinctions between the different types of iterable objects - strings, arrays, lists - the inability to design your own objects that are also usable in the same ways as the built-in objects, these are pretty key aspects of the more recent programming languages.

,,"230 does protect platforms from liability of what their user base posts.  Having run forums and chat servers for a long time, I can attest to the experience of having to moderate content and having received legal complaints.   There are two major factors that people are conflating in these discussions.  There is the direct legal aspect of having illicit content.  The platform is covered if they make an effort to remove illicit content AND they themselves are not encouraging the illegal behavior.  So for example, if they have users that also have admin roles and make sub-forums that promote illegal behavior and they do not warn&#x2F;ban the admins, they may eventually be outside the protection of section 230.<p>Then there is the acceptable use policy of the hosting provider(s). <i>dns, server, cdn, app store</i>  This is entirely outside of 230.  If the provider gets enough complaints, they may eventually see your site as a risk and may choose to terminate your account in order to protect the image of their business.  They do not want their reputation tarnished as it will affect their profits.  I think that is totally fair.  If you want to run a site that may likely provoke emotional response from the public, then in my opinion it would be best to find a hosting provider that accepts the risk in a contract.  The contract should state what is expected of you and what you expect of them and what happens if the contract is to be terminated, such as off-boarding timelines. Smaller startups are at higher risk as they provider has less to lose by booting them off their infrastructure.<p>Where I believe this issue has gone sideways is what the industry believes to be considered an appropriate method of moderation.  The big platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Apple are using automated systems to block or shadow-ban things they consider a risk to their company or their hosting providers.  This leads to people fleeing those systems and going to the smaller startups that do not yet have these automated moderation and shadow-banning systems and that is what happened with Parler and a handful of other newer platforms that wanted to capture all the refuges of the big platforms.  A similar thing is happening with that alternate to Youtube, but I can not remember what it is called.  Bitchute?<p>Another potential problem that may confuse the 230 discussion could be that many powerful politicians and corporate leaders use the big platforms like Twitter and Facebook.  They and big lobbyists and investors may have some influence over the behavior of these platforms and may be able to tell them to squash the sites that do not follow the automated version of banning and shadow-banning.  Does that create echo chambers? Is that what is happening here?  Not sure.  If so, I predict it will push many people under ground and that is probably not great for agents that would like to keep an eye on certain people.",,LinuxBender,,1610481507,2021-01-12T19:58:27Z,comment,25752577,25751802,,,

,,"I&#x27;m a little disappointed with Google. I understand the rationale behind this decision, however instead of improving their browser&#x27;s permissions system, instead of doing a better job reviewing all those crappy extensions that turn to mallware over night (e.g. Window Resizer - and btw, Mozilla is doing a much better job), instead of all of that, they decide to drop the ability to install extensions from third-party source. I predict a similar change will also come for Android. Because grandmas need protection of course.<p>For several months now I have been torn between Chrome and Firefox, not able to decide which I like better, switching back and forth depending on mood. Well, I guess this settles it. I was already using Firefox on my Android exclusively, because it&#x27;s the only mobile browser that has extensions, whereas Google decided that extensions are a nuisance on Android and even if they don&#x27;t admit it, they probably hate the idea of AdBlock making it to Android.<p>Chrome has had a positive effect on the marketplace, but now the negative effects are starting to show up. Adobe for instance decided to drop the support they had for Flash on Linux and only support Chrome, so at present and going forward, if you want the latest Flash on Linux, you&#x27;ve got to use Chrome. My answer was just to disable it of course.<p>But do we really want a monoculture? Haven&#x27;t we had enough with IExplorer 5&#x2F;6? Are we really that dumb?<p>Either way, at the very least Chrome fans should start using Chromium, because the Chrome binary is not open-source and if you use it, you won&#x27;t realize the true difference&#x2F;cost between it and the competition. For example the PDF reader bundled in Chrome is something proprietary, whereas Mozilla bundled a PDF reader that&#x27;s open-source, built in Javascript and that also works in Chromium - you see, whenever Mozilla does something, it usually benefits everybody.",,bad_user,,1392387867,2014-02-14T14:24:27Z,comment,7238611,7237725,,,

,,"Well, again, it&#x27;s just unreasonable to expect masks - alone - to completely eliminate community spread. You&#x27;ve got to think in terms of the reproduction rate R. If it&#x27;s above 1 you&#x27;re losing, if it&#x27;s below 1 you&#x27;re winning. Each measure, like mask wearing, knocks a little fraction off R. The goal is to knock as many little fractions off as possible. It&#x27;s totally possible for masks to &quot;work&quot; in the sense of knocking a worthwhile chunk off R, and yet have the public health strategy as a whole fail to bring it below 1.<p>The trouble is, managing R is an ongoing challenge. If you manage to get it below 1 and the rate of new infections decays to nearly nothing, great! But unless you completely shut the borders to prevent new seed infections, you have to <i>keep doing</i> whatever you were doing. If you relax, then R goes above 1, and exponential growth does its thing again and you&#x27;re back where you started. There&#x27;s a natural ceiling to the exponential growth - nobody <i>quite</i> knows why, though it&#x27;s presumably something to do with acquired immunity - but it&#x27;s a grim place to be.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t look to the UK as an example of how to manage a pandemic.

,,"Barrel charging ports provide a superior user experience: they are easier to use because you can insert the charger at any angle.<p>Barrel connectors are physically much more robust: they can rotate around their axis without imposing any torsional stress on the device being charged, and the longer lever arm inside the charging device (typically 15 mm) means that flexural stress around other axes creates much less force on the connector.  Consequently, they break much less often than pre-C micro-USB connectors.  It&#x27;s too early to tell whether USB-C will improve on its predecessors in this regard, and it may, but it seems unlikely to reach barrel-connector levels of reliability just based on its geometry.<p>Barrel-connector ports are easier to repair when they break: there are only two wires, and they are quite thick.  This is true <i>a fortiori</i> for the cables.<p>Barrel-connector charger faults are easier to diagnose: either the voltmeter tells you it&#x27;s outputting 19 volts open circuit (or whatever the rated voltage is), or it&#x27;s not, or, rarely, it has the correct open-circuit voltage but sags under load, the diagnosis of which requires a voltmeter and a power resistor.  Moreover, they are less likely to occur; you are not going to break a bipolar SMPS with static electricity, not even if it is attached to a 5-volt USB cable, but you can easily do that to the CMOS control chips necessary for USB-C voltage negotiation.<p>Barrel connectors pose less of a security risk: they do not, in most cases, have a data connection at all, and a malicious charger definitely cannot execute a firmware upgrade attack on your device through a barrel connector.<p>Against this list of technical advantages you claim that barrel charging ports are &quot;nonstandard&quot; and &quot;obsolete&quot; — not because of any actual USB-C functionality, nor even because there are more USB-C-chargeable devices in the world than devices with barrel connectors, but just because USB-C is newer and currently fashionable.  The maximally charitable interpretation of your post is that USB-C chargers are capable of providing a range of different voltages, so the complexity of voltage conversion goes into the charger instead of your headphones.  But that&#x27;s an extremely weak argument; a buck converter capable of deriving 5 V 300 mA from, say, 19 V is already much smaller, lighter, and cheaper than a pair of wireless headphones, and adding USB-C charging support to your product <i>also</i> requires a significant BOM cost, <i>and</i> the necessity to operate on 5 V as well as whatever it prefers, though maybe less weight than the buck.<p>What&#x27;s <i>inappropriate</i> is that you&#x27;re attempting to dictate decisions of technical functionality on the grounds of mere fashion and social approval, then shaming others for disagreeing with your judgment rather than supporting it by any actual arguments.<p>I predict that &gt;99% of devices made this year that can only charge through USB-C ports will be nonfunctional in 15 years.  That is, they are cheap trash, designed to be discarded rather than repaired.

Most of them are on the same level as the pundits of the journalism world and often include troll/flame bait headlines which are designed to pit two camps against each other. They tend to be the Zed/Dvorak/TheRegister type people who all openly confess that they are trolling. The ""academic"" articles referenced tend to be mostly flamewars about comp sci education and practice that revolve around languages rather than algorithms or interesting implementations and libraries. I suppose the reason for this is that link sharing websites are often oriented toward leisure time and goofing off and so people are not in a ""I want to learn a new concept"" mode and just want to talk shop and gossip a bit.

However, the currency and lead that universities have both in terms of branding/prestige and state-sponsorship will prevent any major startups in this area and most innovation will take place in university IT departments deploying open source e-education tools.

On an earlier project (let&#x27;s call it project 0), at the same company, back when there was only a few people, we did all documentation in latex with CVS. It was glorious but as soon as a couple of non-technical people joined it was unmanageable and inevitably someone would have to troubleshoot others&#x27; environments, usually eventually giving up and manually merging on another&#x27;s behalf.<p>Then we switched to google drive plus latex&#x2F;CVS. It was not so glorious using both at the same time for the same files. We quickly switched to google docs only, which I came to love for realtime collaboration (a game changer for remote meetings) and its commenting system. It seems very hard to break linked content, like drawings or spreadsheet cells in a document. Keeping your architecture diagrams in a presentation file and linking them to all of your documents is also a game changer (they will automatically update).<p>Google drive also became much better when TeamDrive was added. I like that by design its permissions are not complicated and hierarchical. It&#x27;s not possible to deny permissions to a subfolder in a TeamDrive. But old school IT people think this is a requirement.<p>Besides Confluence, I tried Amazon WorkDocs (useless), Office&#x27;s new collaboration tools (broken) and Office 365 online (not bad but I predict people will just download and work offline meaning 2+ versions in 2+ places).<p>I&#x27;m going to keep using google docs while I can but have Confluence ready for whenever strict onsite requirements are enforced.

Entrepreneurs would have little incentive to take the leaps of faith that have since turned the Internet into, at least in Congress' eyes, the economic powerhouse that it is today.<p>It truly is a wonder that, just now, they are coming around to restricting its freedom (CISPA) and taxing it (the perhaps unintentionally Randian-sounding 'Marketplace Fairness Act'). Not to get all Negative Nancy, but I predict that we are nearing the end of 'The Golden Age of Internet Openness.' Never again will we have this much unfettered and almost-free-as-in-beer access to content and information.

,,"No, your fears aren&#x27;t warranted. In fact, when Apple launched their ARM SoC for their laptop &#x2F; desktop platform, I pointed out that Intel &#x2F; AMD x86-AMD64 processors are now the final bastion of computing freedom as they build <i>general purpose CPUs</i>, and their current business model prevents locking it down to any specific platform.<p>With custom ARM SoCs we are going to see extreme platform lockdowns. (What most people here don&#x27;t get, or are being deliberately obtuse about, is that ARM&#x27;s IP are used to build System-on-Chips where the ARM <i>processor</i> is just one of the units. It is other custom parts of the SoC that allow you to lockdown and make the SoC incompatible with other ARM SoCs).<p>This is how Apple ARM SoCs only fully support ios &#x2F; macOS, Google&#x27;s will only support Android &#x2F; ChromeOS, Microsoft&#x27;s ARM SoC will only fully support Windows etc, and will enforce platform lockdown.<p>To understand why this is happening, we have to recognize the shift in the business model of BigTech - They want to turn everything into a service that will earn them recurring revenue. Platform lockdown will ensure they can force users data on to the cloud by pushing cloud services on these device and limiting their hardware. While initially they will lock down personal data too on to their specific cloud services, regulation may force them to allow &quot;data transfer&quot; between the BigTech services to give consumers the illusion of choice.<p>Remember, PRISM has showed US government how valuable it is to have access to personal data from corporates and how easy it is when it is on the &quot;cloud&quot;. BigTech&#x27;s worldwide reach will allow them to literally spy on anyone in a few decades and the US needs that ability to maintain its influence on world politics.<p>I predict a very bleak future for personal computing, where the concept of <i>ownership</i> of computers or computing device will no longer exist - your device in the future will be fully controlled by the BigTech, and we will have no computing freedom to even install any open source code on &quot;our&quot; device.<p>BigTech is already experimenting with &quot;cloud coding&quot; - this means they will even have access to all your codes in the future too - in such a scenario no competitor will emerge in the future to be able to dislodge them for centuries until they lose political backing.",,webmobdev,,1633248569,2021-10-03T08:09:29Z,comment,28735413,28731349,,,

According to Alexa, Wikipedia is the sixth most visited web site in the world.

In other words, I predict that Quora -- as well as Stack Exchange, which has also taken VC funding -- will be eclipsed within 15 years by sites not funded by VC or other profit-motivated investment.<p>Any competition for Google Search is likely to come from companies like Apple or Microsoft that already have plenty of money to pay engineers or from investor-funded for-profit companies. That is because the ""non-profit sector"" is unlikely to be able to summon up enough skilled labor or funding to compete with Google Search.<p>In contrast, setting up a competitor to Quora or Stack Exchange is relatively easy (especially since these new entrants can learn from Experts Exchange, Stack Exchange and Quora), and going the non-profit route (or the for-profit ""lifestyle business"" route without external funding) does not alienate a large fraction of potential unpaid contributors.",,hollerith,,1360872612,2013-02-14T20:10:12Z,comment,5221833,5221369,,,

Another of our children showed a natural talent with mathematical concepts at about a year old.<p>Even as they grew, our linguist struggled with math (for years) and our procedurally oriented child struggled with language (for years).<p>To this day, these two children maintain these core differences.  It took at least 6 years for our linguist to crack basic arithmetic (even basic addition) which was at  least several years behind our proceduralist.<p>I found out later that some leading child psychologists recognise different brain types in very young children (exactly as I found).  An Internet search on brain types of children will show some high profile child psychologists who talk about this in depth, despite some strong &quot;opinions&quot; (ie. devoid of evidence) that oppose these studies.<p>Our linguist, with minimal pressure, has developed into a strong mathematician (at least grades wise) but to this day has never demonstrated anywhere near the natural ability of our proceduralist.<p>I have drawn the same conclusions with my own siblings and my wife&#x27;s siblings.  At a very young age, our own strengths become apparent without intervention. I am very glad I never pushed my kids to be equal (or even close to equal) in all skills.  I consider most uses of the word &quot;equal&quot; worrisome (except for equal opportunity, a concept frequently downplayed in the last decade or so. Even Zuckerberg&#x27;s famous open letter was unclear on such a fundamental concept).<p>OBS: when I asked our linguist to step through basic math, they understood the concept but could not do the work independently.  Someone in this thread described a similar story for their child and attributed this to a lack of &quot;confidence&quot;. For my child, I wholly reject that it was confidence related.  When things clicked for our linguist, they clicked. If anything, our linguist&#x27;s ability to crack the basics took patience on my part.  I wanted my child to succeed quickly but I restrained myself (thankfully).<p>People need to realise that not all kids are the same. We have innate strengths. We have different learning styles, different learning rates, and different interests and motivations.  I strongly reject the modern populist theory that we are all equal in ability and I believe we do significant harm because of this factoid.  The motives behind this factoid concern me deeply.<p>If I could offer one piece of advice, your child(ren) are unique.  Don&#x27;t ever let anybody tell you that your child&#x27;s strength or weakness comes from social conditioning.  The only social conditioning cones from extreme behaviour (eg. Heavy handed forcing of &quot;equality&quot; under the banner of political correctness is extremely harmful, rather than focussing on potential and opportunity. This heavy handedness is also driving some extremely destructive social engineering under the banner of &quot;equality&quot;.  If you are watching academic trends you should be horrified as a patent).<p>I always encourage(d) play at a young age (physical activity, math games, language games).  However, if you make this more than games (if you call this teaching and you start to measure), you set kids up for failure, especially when many children need patience and time.<p>According to PISA rankings, most western countries (especially English speaking) are not the top performers.

So, a &quot;welcome to Springfield&quot; sign becomes a Pokestop, but the game doesn&#x27;t really know what is there, it just has a picture of it and knowledge that there&#x27;s some kind of landmark there.

We generally don’t need to list the underlying assumptions to build a chain like 2 + 2 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4, but that’s simply based on an assumed context.<p>&gt; 3 Empirical theories which make testable predictions are more likely to be true than empirical theories which can&#x27;t.<p>Again no, being testable has nothing to do with being correct.

Be careful of not adjusting on evidence. The bet trick is very good. Be careful about your utility function.<p>Personally, among the people I know the following doesn&#x27;t happen:<p>&gt; <i>In such cases, the failure mode is that ‘Strong Opinions, Weakly Held’ turns into ‘Strong Opinions, Justified Loudly, Until Evidence Indicates Otherwise, At Which Point You Invoke It To Protect Your Ass.”</i><p>And that is mostly because it&#x27;s really easy to claim you&#x27;re operating in SOWH and really hard to determine if you actually are. So most truth-seekers apply the same techniques of epistemology to it as they do to other things that require auto-evaluation with no objective truth set: you trust weighted external input more than your own. Am I charismatic? Am I intelligent? Am I whiny? It is hard for me to say. It is far easier for me to find that out from people I can identify as trusted on the subject.<p>I remain convinced that operating in SOWH is empowerment (at a 80% certainty har-har). I believe that the Bet Trick and the Sloppy Prior Trick are both clever techniques to improve your search for truth as well.<p>The Bet Trick is very good. My personal danger is that I do not apply linear utility (i.e. an unlikely win makes me much happier than a string of losses). So if I predicted that the US would be open by August and I&#x27;m right that makes me way happier than if I predict repeatedly that median summer temperature is greater than median winter temperature in Saskatoon. I&#x27;m okay losing $200 repeatedly on the former for the win.<p>The Sloppy Prior also has the trick that it allows you to examine your reaction to evidence. Your Sloppy Posterior to the weakest of evidence must be different from your Sloppy Prior! If it isn&#x27;t, your cognition is currently failing you. The only problem is that the sloppiness gives you room to avoid having different posteriors.<p>That last part I find very hard in almost-certain and almost-never situations: if a set of instrument measurements show that temperatures across the Earth are the same as they were 40 years ago, then it&#x27;s highly likely that the measurements are broken, but it is not certain, so my posteriors for AGW given that evidence should drop.

,,"It&#x27;s not about performance (nothing memcache does or more precisely -- given all new features I am likely unaware about --  when it was first rewritten in C is particularly CPU intensive), it&#x27;s about memory management and efficiency: a in-memory system serves to reduce latency by using large amounts of memory; tuning the JVM to handle managed heaps larger than ~24gb (with only half to 2&#x2F;3 of that usable for caching data)  is doable but pretty much a black art if you want to avoid huge latency spikes caused by garbage collection pauses (which defeats the purpose of an in-memory store). Even if pauses are rare enough as not to affect 95-pctile latency (or if you don&#x27;t care about 95-th pctile latency) in a highly-available system they introduce one of the more nasty distributed systems failures -- node A talks to node B and goes into a GC pause; node B thinks node A is dead, node A thinks node B is dead -- because when it didn&#x27;t receive a reply to its outstanding requests until after it emerged from a GC pause triggering a timeout (all in the mean while certain figures from RDBMS community insist this didn&#x27;t actually occur because &quot;partitions never happen in a single datacenter...&quot;)<p>While it&#x27;s very much possible to directly allocate and manage memory yourself in Java -- and I have done that ( <a href=""http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hbase-commits/201306.mbox/%3C20130613181824.1A81E23889ED@eris.apache.org%3E"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mail-archives.apache.org&#x2F;mod_mbox&#x2F;hbase-commits&#x2F;20130...</a> ) -- but without memory safety guarantees, without the great tooling, without the general idea that &quot;if your code compiles, it  will probably work correctly&quot;. In other words, you&#x27;re programming a very verbose and ugly (see DirectByteBuffer interface) C. There&#x27;s many cases where this approach (&quot;off-heap memory&quot;) makes sense when building memory intensive apps in Java that clearly benefit everywhere else from being written in Java: JNI is unpleasant to work with, JNA adds additional performance penalties on top of those imposed by JNI calls that it makes under the cover -- which is fine in many cases, but remember that reading files or sockets are also JNI calls -- but less so when you&#x27;re building a system that distinguishes itself by being in memory.<p>On the other hand, if you use C (or &quot;C+&quot; a.k.a. &quot;C with objects&quot;, or -- as I prefer to say to avoid confusion with libraries like glib or apr or the Linux vfs layer, all successful object oriented systems written in regular C -- &quot;C with templates&quot;) you have accesses to the existing works (advanced allocators like jemalloc and tcmalloc don&#x27;t work very well with JVM), excellent memory-debugging tools, and so on...<p>I will say this: I think <i>more</i> software rather than less should be written in higher level languages. I absolutely love OCaml, Erlang, and Lisps (especially those -- like Typed Racket and Clojure -- that have started importing features from Haskell&#x2F;ML family), like what I see in Go. I use Python (and formerly Perl) on a daily basis for &quot;casual programming&quot;, to experiment with new ideas, and automation. I&#x27;ve written a great deal of software in Java, where many people blinked the idea that this category of software could be more than a toy in Java. I think garbage collection could be great improved and I see no theoretical reasons why, e.g., compilers can&#x27;t be written in OCaml as opposed to C or C++ (I do see practical reasons having to do with runtime, lack of multi-core support but that&#x27;s a separate and fixable issue). I find projects aimed at making systems programming in high-level languages fascinating (e.g., Mirage OS, Microsoft&#x27;s experiments, Jikes RVM, etc...)<p>However, even if these theoretical strides are achieved, there&#x27;s always going to be room for C -- in the end, you need systems that give you great deal of control and act in a very deterministic and predictable fashion . In the mean while, however, there&#x27;s also need to build practical systems -- so while C and C++ may not be ideal in theory, they are often the only realistic option in practice.<p>[1] Note, however, I didn&#x27;t say anything about performance -- OCaml, Java, Haskell, LuaJit etc.. do well in the Debian benchmarks; Lisps follow those languages closely. Likewise, many high-level languages can be AOT compiled. While when written by a strong programmer and&#x2F;or assisted by today&#x27;s excellent optimizing compilers C will still beat these fast high-level languages in most cases, it should be noted that today it&#x27;s extremely difficult to write assembly code by hand that beats assembly code written by an optimizing C compiler or even the JVM. I predict that when a language comes about that has a better designed type system than C&#x2F;C++ and yet still provides ability to control memory layout much as C does, eventually compilers for that language will emit assembly code that beats assembly emitted by C compilers for the same reason compiler-written assembly beats hand-written assembly -- compiler is able to leverage the type information (declared or -- in the case of dynamically typed languages with fast runtimes -- inferred) to aid optimization.",,strlen,,1386366096,2013-12-06T21:41:36Z,comment,6864006,6861751,,,
,,"Long answer since I have been thinking about this since my school days.<p>Somewhere in the mid 90s, there was a boom in the IT sector in India - jobs in IT paid 2-3x more than other jobs. Most people who could buy new houses and cars worked in IT. This lead to a push from most parents to put their children into an engineering undergraduate program. Companies like TCS hire people from all branches of Engineering for IT jobs. They retrain the new hires given that the coursework is terrible in most universities anyway and don&#x27;t care whether you specialized in mechanical engineering or computer engineering.<p>Of the 300 that finished high school with me, 50 went into commerce and management related programs, 200 went into engineering. Only 1 high-performer (who incidentally was a girl and thus could, by societal norms, &quot;risk not getting a job since she would get married anyway&quot;) took an alternate path - pursuing a top-notch program in social sciences.<p>For a long time, the only way of getting an assured cushy job was to pick some branch of engineering and getting hired by TCS, CTS or Infosys in campus hiring drives.<p>This and the booming middle income class who could afford college education but needed a job guarantee at the end of it caused a precipitous drop in the quality of people pursuing pure-science and math programs in the country (very few are still considered prestigious) and an explosion in the number of engineering colleges. When I finished my undergrad in 2010, my university alone had 400+ affiliated engineering colleges, churning out &gt; 10000 graduates every year. Most of my batchmates (B.Tech in IT) couldn&#x27;t code despite going through a 4 year program.<p>This also meant that vocational programs like carpentry and plumbing were criminally underpaid to the point where it is now hard to find skilled carpenters and plumbers below the age of 40. Agriculture became a thing for only the poorest. A previous push towards vocational training was shot down as casteist [1] and politicians will dare not even mention it anymore because of that.<p>Things are making a comeback though, Taxi cab drivers are earning salaries comparable to what junior developers do for the first time in decades thanks to Ola and Uber. Vocational programs are going to become necessary within the next 10-15 years.

,,"This is a good question about the macro US economy.  In general I agree with GP.<p>Fact:
The Fed has injected large amounts of cash into the asset markets using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quantitative_easing</a> .  I&#x27;ve never added up the cash as a percentage of GDP or one of the Ms, but it always seemed significant (i.e. 5-10% of GDP, but this is debatable).  I should caveat by saying that this cash never entered general circulation, which has meant treating it as part of the monetary supply is tricky.<p>Now, based on this fact of Fed intervention there are a few opinions:<p>1. While the Fed directly isn&#x27;t buying equities (i.e. stocks, but this is as far as we know), its presence means that all the other cash holders have to seek out other investments to get inflation-beating rates of returns.  There isn&#x27;t hard data to support this, but it is the conventional wisdom of both people in the game and macro economists.<p>2. The magnitude of the impact on the asset markets is up for debate.  I&#x27;ve seen numbers as low as -5% and has high as 60% of last year&#x27;s stock market returns can be attributed to the Fed intervention.  Some of the difficulty is that there was large federal fiscal stimulus impacting during this time, and counter-intuitively there is some argument that the Fed neutralized the fiscal stimulus to hold inflation rates constant.  The important part is that there was a stock market surge, and it is not a result of retail investors pouring in money: It is a result of institutions balancing away from bonds to stocks (this is what the GP means by &quot;supply-side&quot;).  It&#x27;s just not clear if the institutions did it because they have confidence in the economy or if they were &quot;forced&quot; by the Fed.  The &quot;why&quot; is opinion, and many people believe the fed is the &quot;why.&quot;<p>3. On the micro side, seeing 20-something kids get 150k budgets to screw around for a year is maddening.  &quot;It&#x27;s ok, VCs play the numbers game... we just need one tulip to pay 100x.&quot;  There is too much money chasing &quot;talent&quot; right now, and should the correction to the asset market happen this year (as I predict from the fed&#x27;s cessation) then we will see the startup bubble unwind.",,yajoe,,1388786756,2014-01-03T22:05:56Z,comment,7008548,7008361,,,

If you assume von Neumann probes and Dyson spheres are possible, then star light is incompatible with the existence of advanced technology.<p>While life appeared very early in the history of the earth, technologically advanced life took billions of years to evolve. You require a planet with an extraordinarily stable climate to allow a technological society to evolve and I predict this is the filter.<p>Just one factor contributing to this stability is the need for a very large moon to keep the axis of rotation stable over billion of years.

,,"A lot of comments here are conflating the notions of &quot;property ownership gives individuals a stake in the system&quot; and property requirements for voting. They&#x27;re not nearly the same thing.<p>To understand the point of the author you need to look back, deeply back, at the history of human society. For most of human history, most people did not own any property. In a feudal society, for example, a few lords owned everything, and everyone else worked for them and owned nothing.<p>The &quot;American experiment&quot; was radical in that it placed the individual at the center of governance. The U.S. system of government is &quot;built up&quot; from citizen consent, not &quot;pushed down&quot; from a divinely-granted right of hereditary rule.<p>In order for this system to work, citizens must own property. Otherwise, they don&#x27;t have the resources to collectively enact change. The Bill of Rights presumes citizens who have the resources to speak, associate, petition, etc. That&#x27;s why it is worded to constrain the government&#x27;s power, not worded to grants things to citizens.<p>The fundamental idea behind American democracy is that Americans have the means to pursue their goals and to influence each other.<p>This is why it was so much easier for early U.S. citizens to found churches and corporations than it was in Europe. European churches and corporations were top-down, and therefore few and conservative. U.S. organizations were bottom-up, and therefore many, diverse, and innovative.<p>So... that&#x27;s why property ownership is at the heart of American democracy.<p>But what about:<p>&gt; deliberate and intentional effort has been made to ensure that only people who own a lot of property have any voice in the system<p>There&#x27;s actually a lot of evidence against this, for example the entire labor and environmental movements. Collective citizen action has worked a lot of change to the U.S. over the years, and I predict it will continue to do so.<p>All that said, I think it&#x27;s a pretty far reach to claim that the American experiment is at risk because a few people don&#x27;t want to buy CD&#x27;s or cars anymore. People still like money and things! The real estate market is not drying up. There&#x27;s plenty of property being owned and desired by Americans.<p>I think that lack of money is a bigger issue. Over 40 million people in the U.S. live below the poverty line!

,,"The purpose of my note was not to suggest ways to reduce CO2 emissions.  It was to counter the assertion that desalination is impractical because it necessarily increases them.  The scope of this discussion was limited to addressing that assertion, not to list ways to reduce CO2 emissions in general.<p>Rainwater collection is not a substitute for desalination because in many years there is little or no rain.  The author&#x27;s principal position is that there is no drought because once every 10 or 20 years there is (or was) a wet one; of course, to conclude this he includes the extremely wet 2004 and excludes the extremely dry 2013-2015.  Even if we ignore his cherry-picking, that position is not a sensible one; it is equivalent to asserting that with an infinitely large reservoir, California would always have enough water regardless of the consumption rate.  The reality is that consumption exceeds the long-term average supply by a considerable margin and has increased due to population growth even as the likely future supply is shrinking.  Furthermore, large quantities of water cannot be stored forever; it evaporates, seeps into the ground, or both.  The wet years, rare even in the past and likely to be moreso in the future, don&#x27;t come often enough to keep reservoirs full.  There&#x27;s also the problem of the inland cities, where even historical average rainfall is far below 14 inches a year, which the author conveniently ignores.<p>Rainwater collection and recycling of treated sewage are therefore necessary but insufficient measures (at least in southern and inland California; they&#x27;re probably sufficient for places like Eureka).  In addition to those measures, additional sources will have to be found and&#x2F;or large-scale reductions in consumption will be required.  Desalination is perhaps the only plausible means of increasing supply (all Western river systems are already critically oversubscribed), and while it is costly, it does come without the political problems of forcibly reducing consumption.  As such, I predict that solar-powered desalination will eventually become the central piece of the state&#x27;s response to its water shortage.  It does a good job of matching plentiful resources (solar energy, ocean water) to visible needs (more water for coastal cities).  It does not address the needs of agriculture, but nothing can.  The only policy options with respect to agriculture are in assigning the required curtailments.  For political reasons, they&#x27;ll probably also build more storage, but the practical benefits of that storage to agricultural users will be minimal as it will be empty or dead pool most of the time.<p>These aren&#x27;t things anyone wants to hear, but they&#x27;re reality.  The author, like many others, is whistling past the graveyard.  Anyone who believes that simple, inexpensive measures can address the problem is in denial of its true scope and scale.",,fredkbloggs,,1434644047,2015-06-18T16:14:07Z,comment,9739568,9738927,,,

,,"This may touch on some points I've already addressed [1] but I have to say something.<p>I was a frequent contributor to StackOverflow [2] but have largely stopped for a number of reasons, the most important of which is I got a new job that took up much more of my time.<p>But another reason is that for me, as a (then) frequent answerer, it got a whole lot less <i>interesting</i>. This was due to two factors:<p>1. A lot of the low-hanging fruit had been answered so the questions became increasingly esoteric such that you were less likely to simply know an answer and had to spend more time researching. That extra time meant you were also less <i>rewarded</i> for the answer because less people were in a position to state that it was correct or not (if you consider karma a ""reward""); and<p>2. The ceaseless campaign against ""interesting"" questions due to increasing closure due to ""subjective and argumentative"" and the fragmentation of SO into the many StackExchange sites (causing a lot of questions to be migrated).<p>There are three basic errors that Joel has (and Jeff had) made (IMHO):<p>1. Over-emphasis on editing.<p>In my mind there are three groups: askers, answerers and editors. Jeff &#38; Joel made statements about editors are important and how editing is super-important, basically trying o elevate it to the same level as answering questions.<p>This is a problem.<p>Editors are the bureaucrats of the StackOverflow ecosystem. The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy [3]. The more editors you have the less each has to do. Rather than doing less, the kinds of people attracted to this kind of function prefer to simply <i>create</i> work for themselves.<p>What's more, from Meta StackOverflow, from interacting from the people who edit a lot (and answer very little if anything), this simply reinforced my view: these are the kinds of people who destroy communities.<p>Those who can, answer. Those who can't, edit.<p>I've seen many spurious edits to many of my higher voted answers. Some capitalize something. Others come along and uncapitalize it. I've seen people come and add lines to my answers saying I stole it from someone else (seriously).<p>The net result is virtually any highly voted answer I have has been edited into community wiki oblivion. That creates a strong disincentive for me to spend time coming up with a good answer: I'll basically get limited credit from it and then have to watch as wanna-be editors essentially vandalize it.<p>The other thing these people do is close questions on the drop of a hat. They, as a group, tend to have an incredibly festidious nature when it comes to the enforcement of rules. They constantly seek some purer, higher standard and don't quite get that those rules are <i>guidelines</i> that are a means to an end and not an end in themselves.<p>2. ""Subjective and argumentative"".<p>Jeff and Joel from the outset wanted to prevent flame war type questions, the kind of questions that have no definite answer. Questions like ""Is Ruby better than Python?"" That's fine but it's been taken too far, in part by the very editors I previously mentioned.<p>Questions like ""Should I use Angular.js or Ember.js for developing a CRUD-type Web application?"" would be shut down in a minute. But the extra context matters. You can answer that question by giving a list of comparative advantages without being necessarily biased or inflammatory. That's actually interesting content, particularly if you're trying to decide between a number of new technologies, languages, etc. But alas SO seems keen on shutting that down; and<p>3. Fragmentation.<p>There is another thread today about the difficulty of music classification [4]. The same goes for Q&#38;A. Hierarchical classification schemes are too limited for Q&#38;A. There are SO questions that have bounced around between a number of SE sites for this reason.<p>Just look at the Stack Exchange sites [5]. If I want to ask a question about being a programmer do I ask on OnStartups, on the Programmer SE or elsewhere?<p>The pragmatic answer is that there are some question that naturally fit on several sites. Yet the hierarchical pigeon-holing with esoteric and often subjective rules means it's harder to find content, it's hard to find where to place content and newbies inevitably get chastised for posting on the wrong site.<p>There is a reason tagging exists and is successful. Describe the traits of the question or, better yet, figure it out from the content, and show it when it's relevant to someone. Don't make me hunt across sites for it. That's a ridiculous solution.<p>I predict you'll see the rise of more tagging-oriented (at a higher level than say Java or C++) and automatic classification Q&#38;A sites in the future.<p>With that out of my system, let me address som eof the points the OP specifically raised:<p>&#62; The Eternal September Issue.<p>This one annoys me. And I don't mean new people. The negative reaction people have to them (eg [6]). When a community starts chastising newbies, that reflects badly on the community, not the newbies.<p>&#62; Down voting as a means of closing a question.<p>The one part of downvoting I don't like is people use it as a means of saying ""I disagree with this"" (on purely subjective grounds), which is not the intended purpose. That problem seems to be nearly universal with voting systems (even here). The one good thing SO does is ""charge"" you for downvotes. That alone stops it being a huge problem (IMHO).<p>&#62; This is another one of the odd cases on StackOverflow. A few of the “Exact Duplicate” questions are not duplicates due to minor, but important, differences.<p>True. The problem here again is that you have editors deciding to close things that they don't necessarily know anything about. The same problem infests Wikipedia (deleting articles on ""notability"" grounds).<p>&#62; The value of reputation: After the global recalculation, the site’s creators made a bold statement that participation is not valued on the site.<p>I actually don't know what this is referring to but then again I've been largely inactive. There have been several recalculations though (eg question upvotes from 10 to 5 karma). I don't really have a problem with this. If you're too obsessed with your karma, you're focusing on the wrong things. And I like that the same rules apply to everyone (eg it's better than question upvotes before X are 10, after X are 5).<p>I worried when SO took VC money that they were going to turn something that is very successful in one segment and ruin it with attempts at making a general Q&#38;A platform. 2+ years on I'm still failing to see traction in the SE sites beyond SO. This may yet still become a problem.<p>Perhaps the simplest answer here is that SO isn't a ""community"" as such. It went with the Q&#38;A format (over, say, forums) to discourage discussion. People often criticized it for making discussion hard when that was kinda the point.<p>I certainly never went to SO to hang out. Some do I'm sure.

,,"The most interesting thing about these recent trends is human nature.<p>I remember back in year 2000/2001 how everybody was talking about freedom, open-source and the open nature of the Internet. I remember how the closed garden that Microsoft tried to create was frowned upon. Small companies that were picking the Internet as a delivery platform and using open-source/multi-platform technologies were on the forefront of innovation. Of course regular consumers and businesses never cared, but as Paul Graham once said, if you want to see the future trends in computing, you have to look at what hackers are using today.<p>Then OS X happened, this UNIX-compatible OS that was shiny and cool and all of your UNIX tools were compatible with it and you could run some pretty important proprietary software too, like MS Office or Photoshop. It was more productive for developers than Windows. Compared to Linux it was friendlier to all people. And suddenly Apple was hip again and it slowly captured the hearts of developers.<p>Then the iPhone happened and people didn't mind that it was a closed garden, because there has never been anything like it. Anything that Apple allowed on this new platform, it was taken as a gift, as it was their platform, so if they wanted to ban an app for ""duplicating existing functionality"" then openness be damned, it was their product after all. Then the stories about lone developers getting rich on the App Store happened, and people didn't mind being at the behest of Apple, as long as they could have some piece of that awesome pie.<p>Of course, countless of reasons were given by tech pundits, trying to rationalize the walled garden they've created - it is better for grandmas that have their PCs ridden with viruses, it is better for the protection of our children, it exposes computing to a wider mass (even though computing in this context means mostly consumption), it solves the problem of app marketing for individual developers without huge marketing budgets, etc... there's always some reason for why Apple was right to act the way it did. Even now that they've released a shitty GMaps replacement, some genuinely believe that they had no choice, when for a company like Apple there are always choices available.<p>Let's not forget for a moment the ultimate argument against this closed garden: if you don't like it, you are free to go somewhere else.<p>And now Apple started suing left and right, which in my opinion is what companies do when finding themselves in the innovator's dilemma, and is doing so while dropping the ball on new versions of its products. They are still successful and they might produce some more golden eggs in the future, but the innovation frenzy of the iPod era is over and they know it.<p>And yet people still cheer for them, even though as far as openness is concerned, Apple makes Microsoft look good. And it was only 12 years ago that people hated Microsoft with a passion for being an obstacle to innovation, even though Microsoft never banned any app from running on Windows or restricted its usage only to certain hardware (but surprise, since Apple has been doing it so successfully, Microsoft is going to start doing it with Windows 8 ... hurray for the renewed and totally not evil Microsoft).<p>I own an Android phone and an iPad. I love my iPad, but it was a gift and I secretly yearn for a Nexus tablet that has the same size + 3G. I also voted with my wallet against apps like Instagram, because I'm primarily an Android user and the aesthetic senses of developers like Marco don't really solve any my problems.<p>I also remember the day I got my Galaxy S, even though I owned an iPhone 3GS ... I got out of my way to buy one out of frustration because Apple was banning apps for blocking calls and SMS messages from specific phone numbers (but hey, look how it ""just works""). And I predict similar frustration levels as use-cases for my iPad are unfolding. Already I'm pretty pissed off about my carrier having the ability to enable/disable the tethering option on my iPad.<p>If this is the future of computing, then I shudder to think of the consequences.",,bad_user,,1348490384,2012-09-24T12:39:44Z,comment,4564313,4563913,,,

,,"<i>I would be really interested to hear why you think robotics is easy?</i><p>So, most of the robotics we deal with is pretty straightforward, right? For the algorithms, it's motion planning, communication, modeling uncertainty, and so on. For the hardware, it's control theory, light power supplies, strong materials, etc. These are not ""hard"" problems, they are merely expensive ones. Better technology or more funding will almost certainly solve these issues, and these are the main chunks of robotics research I see today--and that is why I don't consider robotics necessarily ""hard"". It seems to be straightforward engineering, not science or mathematics.<p>The Asimo is an excellent piece of engineering, and I would buy a beer for any of its engineers were I to run across them. That said, a lot of the reason it's taken so long is that the supporting tech has had to be worked around. If we had infinitely fast computers, with infinitely fast actuators, running on infinitely long-lived batteries, robotics would be damned easy--don't confuse technological disadvantages with real difficulty.<p><i>Humans will find other niches. Taking robotics to the extreme will mean that survival will become extremely cheap if not free since machines will be able to do most if not all for us. It won't matter if you are unemployed since your personal robot is already doing all the work. i.e. Farming, house building, maintenance, clothe manufacturing, cooking. Etc. Etc.<p>So you see, we may evolve into a society that may not need to work so unemployment is a non issue. The real issue is what will we do with all our free time?<p>I predict that most of society will still work but only in what interests them, no longer will people need to be stuck in a crappy job longing to work on their dreams.

Which is trivial.<p>I very much agree with the general premise, but:<p>- I don&#x27;t necessarily agree that it is <i>necessarily</i> (in all cases) trivial.<p>- Radicated beliefs can also promote&#x2F;reinforce other beliefs.  Now, your statement does not assert the opposite or rule it out, I suspect it is likely a consequence of the natural ambiguity of the English language and standard writing conventions, but I believe it is noteworthy that third parties reading conversations such as this may have their perception of reality distorted by not realizing such things, and generally speaking I believe that this can be harmful in some cases.  I also believe that this demonstrates the correctness of the first few lines of the Tao Te Ching.<p>&gt; That has nothing to do with religion...<p>This seems like a bold claim to me.  I believe I can and have demonstrated otherwise (above).  If you disagree, I would enjoy discussing the relative merits of our individual perspectives (perspectives that a human consciousness &quot;takes&quot; (often without being willed, or our conscious knowledge) <i>upon reality</i>, as opposed reality itself (which we do not have direct access to) is an important part of the ideas I am doing my best to communicate).<p>&gt; ...which may sometimes use &quot;&quot;&quot;belief&quot;&quot;&quot;, but is not belief - if you mixed up the (different and opposite) things, you would be using a very weak terminology.<p>Here you seem to be suggesting that you have accurate knowledge of the mental state of billions of people on the planet.

A third party might read that sentence and form the conclusion that that is <i>all that I am doing</i>.  Now, it may be true that that is all I&#x27;m doing, but I am now asserting explicitly that it is not.  A third party now has the explicit option to decide which one of us has a more accurate description of reality.<p>Note also that I said: &quot;The thing that I like about Taoism is that it is an extremely abstract religion...&quot;, and when one is taking an abstract perspective, ambiguity <i>naturally</i> manifests in many cases, does it not?  In some ways this is a bug, but in other ways it is simultaneously a feature.<p>&gt; Either you are attempting to take that elected subject as a belief system (what?! why?! how?! why?!), which would be contradictory with the first stanza - and would be mental poison, the actual subject (&quot;let one now accept the false in ideas, outside formulas&quot;) -, or you take it as religion (in this case: &quot;[We witness] there is a way, [find it]: mind you, first of all: it cannot be put in statements&quot;), so there is no radicated belief to curb other beliefs (explicitly in the case you chose, as beliefs are things you can put in statements).<p>For starters, this is a false dichotomy (an extremely common mode of thinking, I believe, based on several years of closely observing millions of human beings describe reality to each other on social media platforms).  Of course, this doesn&#x27;t mean that it is <i>necessarily</i> wrong (in this case), but it is surely not great odds, or an optimal perspective to take upon any issue.<p>&gt; ...which would be contradictory with the first stanza...<p>I think I do not understand what you mean by this, could you explain in a different way?<p>&gt; ...and would be mental poison...<p>Also this.<p>&gt; ...or you take it as religion (in this case: &quot;[We witness] there is a way, [find it]: mind you, first of all: it cannot be put in statements&quot;), so there is no radicated belief to curb other beliefs (explicitly in the case you chose, as beliefs are things you can put in statements).<p>If I understand you correctly....personally, I do &quot;take&quot; Taoism not only ~&quot;as a religion&quot;, but also as kind of the foundation of my mental model of reality, and it <i>very much</i> is a radicated belief that exerts a strong influence on my beliefs.  An example of this is when I encounter someone whose model of reality disagrees with mine: in such cases it is very common for someone to say things like &quot;[reality] &quot;is(!)&quot; X&quot;, but very often the person making that statement does not realize that they are referring to their personal model of reality as a proxy for reality itself, or, they do not consider the distinction between the two to be important (I know this from many hundreds of prior conversations - one thing interesting I have noticed in these conversations: I regularly encounter a phenomenon where if you even inject this simple and academically uncontroversial idea into a conversation (reality vs perception of), people&#x27;s cognition will often start to behave like it is driven by a script[1]).<p>I think my main point about the value of Taoism as a base methodology for building one&#x27;s model of reality is that it is a very simple method for moderating the often harmful behaviors of evolved human consciousness, the main one being that consciousness manufactures and projects a synthetic, predictive model of reality into the conscious mind, and the conscious mind considers this to be reality itself[2].  Now it&#x27;s true that one kind of &quot;has to&quot; &quot;take this as it is&quot;, but it is often incorrectly asserted that <i>not</i> taking it as it is will <i>necessarily</i> result in ~cognitive paralysis.  That idea itself is <i>yet another</i> subconscious prediction of reality, perceived as reality itself.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if you and I are talking about two entirely different things (likely, at least to some degree), but hopefully this helps clarify where it is that I am coming from.  To me, these ideas are endlessly fascinating, but they very often seem to have the exact opposite effect on other people, so hopefully that is not the case here.<p>[1] Regarding &quot;common scripts&quot;: in response to the types of ideas that I am referring to here, a relatively small set of rhetorical rebuttals&#x2F;dismissals are most likely to arise in a response:<p>- Solipsism: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solipsism"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solipsism</a><p>- Gish Gallop:  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gish_gallop"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gish_gallop</a><p>- Sealioning&#x2F;JAQing off: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sealioning"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sealioning</a><p>- &#x2F;r&#x2F;iamverysmart (a person trying very hard to look smart)  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;iamverysmart&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;iamverysmart&#x2F;</a><p>- Ad Hominem: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ad_hominem"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ad_hominem</a><p>- Pedantry&#x2F;Over-thinking: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pedant"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pedant</a><p>- Lol: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lindsayannlearning.com&#x2F;rhetoric-in-social-media&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lindsayannlearning.com&#x2F;rhetoric-in-social-media&#x2F;</a><p>- downvote (or not, it is technically unknown) with no reply (sometimes one will even attract a following of downvoters of every other comment one might make on a platform - this has happened to me on two occasions right here on HN, as confirmed by dang after I reported it after several months in each case).<p>An excellent post on how and why people may make these mistakes: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;FaJaCgqBKphrDzDSj&#x2F;37-ways-that-words-can-be-wrong"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;FaJaCgqBKphrDzDSj&#x2F;37-ways-th...</a>  Also relevant are software concepts like Equals() or the [is] operator.<p>For the sake of argument&#x2F;discussion, if one considers it to be possibly true that what I say here is accurate (I have studied this &quot;extensively&quot;, and I <i>propose to you</i> that it is indeed very true, and I not only welcome <i>but encourage</i> disagreement, however &quot;pedantic&quot; it may be (provided it is offered with a desire for epistemic soundness)), it suggests something very interesting about the human mind, as well as reality itself: that many&#x2F;most people perceive reality (or portions of it at least) according to a common and predictable (simple) algorithm, which is very different than how they perceive they perceive reality.  And if people&#x27;s perception of reality is <i>objectively and significantly</i> ~manufactured <i>and incorrect</i>....then what is reality, <i>really</i>?  And if this is true, another interesting question might be: <i>is it (or might it plausibly be) important</i>?<p>If you find this short description to be unconvincing, there is a lot more supporting evidence and ideas where these came from.<p>(For fun:  I predict that as you are reading this explicit list of ~invalid rebuttals, your &quot;spider senses&quot; may be going off in some way, perhaps a suspicion that I am &quot;up to something&quot;.  If that is the case, I would say that sense is accurate - there is indeed more than one reason why I have gone through the trouble of explicitly documenting this list of common human behaviors <i>in this particular conversation</i>.   I think it would be interesting to see what would happen on a platform where ideas&#x2F;phenomena like this were <i>first class ideas&#x2F;rules</i>, kind of like HN has a set of rules and cultural norms.

There would obviously be a massive learning curve for new members (overcoming evolution is a tough row to hoe), but some people could surely manage it.)<p>[2] People commonly seem to consider this idea to outright false, I suspect because the natural tendency is to consider it <i>with respect to oneself</i> (which significantly alters the cognitive processing of the idea, as is well known in psychology).  But if one considers it with respect to other people (a technique of choosing the members of one&#x27;s outgroup, like Trump supporters, antivaxxers, etc often makes the mind not only much more accepting of it, but often <i>downright eager</i>), it can be much easier to see the accuracy of it.",,mistermann,,1633972567,2021-10-11T17:16:07Z,comment,28830593,28826324,,,

,,"What's an interesting segue to this is that fundamentally the ""language understanding"" issues are mostly red herrings. The gold standard within the legal profession we are constantly led to believe is to pursue a standard of objective fairness and justice which would be better defined by deterministic, logical languages like programming languages rather than fuzzy, broad languages like English.<p>It is far, far easier to have laws written in code and execute test cases based on those laws before even investing any capital into a venture which may require edge cases of a given law, rather than the current scenario of hemming and hawing around a fundamentally subjective and fuzzy area and eventually subjecting your endeavour to the rigors of being a legal ""test case"" consisting of much ado about nothing and the outcome is as close to random as anything else.<p>When you reduce the legal profession to coding and writing test cases though, hell will freeze over the next day. Such a politically powerful faction will <i>never</i> allow themselves to be marginalised in this way, even if they claim to desperately be striving for exactly the kind of scenarios that this would allow; universal access to a completely objective justice system with etc etc etc. The extent to which this is actually impossible is somewhat depressing because it's something of an expose on the hypocrisy implicit in the claims of the legal system to actually serve the public, rather than itself.<p>But hey, that's life. If it ever <i>does</i> happen my wager is it will be because it is forced on them through market forces, the public at large simply uses alternatives venues for mediation and the legal system is forced to compete with it.

CEO Tim Cook focuses too much on preserving revenues streams, rather than disrupt them as predecessor Steve Jobs risked so many times.</i><p>Stuff like this makes me think this guy is a jackass. Steve Jobs never &quot;disrupted an established revenue stream&quot; - in 1999 he started with nothing, and built everything from scratch. He died with the company in full throttle, and that&#x27;s that. Never had the need or the chance to do what this author is suggesting.<p>Furthermore, how exactly can you fault Apple&#x2F;Cook&#x27;s performance post-2011? Their releases have all been solid improvements which have sold like hotcakes. Their products still command global consumer consciousness like no other brand. The iPhone and iPad stand as the centre of gravity of the mobile market, and the confusion and noise of the myriad products churned out by Apple&#x27;s ertswhile competition only further cements their stature. Other than a few small exceptions (screen size in particular), they still control the focus of consumer desire - the average consumer only knows and cares about a particular feature once Apple has pointed to it. Watch what happens post-5s - if other phone manufacturers release a spree of devices with novel unlocking mechanisms, you can guess why.<p>Everything Apple has done has been profitable and popular. They&#x27;re playing from a position of incredible strength, so why should they rush out and reinvent the wheel? They have time, their current position is stable, and it would only advantage competitors to reveal their next plans before Apple is ready or it is even necessary to do so.<p>I think the mistake people make here is in confusing what happened to Microsoft with what might hypothetically happen to Apple. But Apple isn&#x27;t Microsoft. There&#x27;s no indication whatsoever that Apple is taking their current strength for granted - moves like the new campus suggest a firm focus on and faith in a very long-term future. The only people who are dissatisfied with Apple&#x27;s performance are impatient, ignorant tech commentators, who seem to depend for their sense of self-worth on a deluge of new gadgets to critique. It&#x27;s a serious cognitive failure to imagine that just because Apple overturned incumbents, Apple must be equally vulnerable to being overturned, as if the marketplace just cycles through the same rough dynamic with little to no variation. Apple blew the competition out of the water because it was better, and in so doing it set a new bar for product and ecosystem execution that until now no other device manufacturer could equal - a bar which it has only maintained and even raised.<p>We&#x27;re only now starting to see the market rebalance with Google and Amazon emerging as real competitors, with Microsoft a big question mark about when and if they will ever rise to the occasion. But the ball is thoroughly in the competition&#x27;s court, so right now Apple can watch, analyse, and plot its next move.

,,"Maybe the choice of title was a bad move on Wolfram&#x27;s part? Your argument makes sense; it doesn&#x27;t predict anything, or show any hint of science. Based on what I recall of the book (I did read it - everything except the appendix&#x2F;notes), and what I&#x27;ve read of this new article (I didn&#x27;t finish it - I will read it in full at a later point, though), it can&#x27;t predict anything.<p>What I mean is that these simple rule programs can&#x27;t be run any faster than the universe in which they are running. So you can&#x27;t say &quot;I predict this simple rule set will eventually draw a butterfly&quot; (or whatever) - because you couldn&#x27;t run it long enough for that to occur.<p>In a way, it&#x27;s a simulation (or emulation) problem; just as you need a more powerful computer to run software to emulate a system in real time, provided that system is less powerful - you would need to do the same in order to run these simple programs. In essence, since the theory espoused in NKS (more or less - at least, that is what I got out of it - and maybe I am wrong) is that the universe at its base level (quarks? dunno) is composed and operates and creates based on these simple rules, in order to go faster than our universe (and catch up), you&#x27;d have to have a more powerful system than whatever the universe is running on (conjecture, I know - and Wolfram noted this as well IIRC).<p>So right now - just like if you were wanting to emulate a PS4 on a contemporary PC - the only way you can do it is non-realtime; you have to be satisfied at running the system at a slower rate. What is interesting about this - and this is pure speculation - let&#x27;s say you are running &quot;rule 30&quot; on a computer, and unknown to you, it is actually computing a new universe (that is, simulating it) - to you, it is happening much more slowly than realtime - but to anyone &quot;inside&quot; that universe, they can&#x27;t relatively know that they are running slower - their sense of &quot;time&quot; is &quot;normal&quot;...<p>I&#x27;d like to encourage you to read the book in full and maybe this new article as well.

Although at that point, you need something crazy to uplink the switches.  40GE is emerging, or you could use a non-ethernet option.  SANs are the big application for 10GE now since you can comfortably fit all the clients and servers on a standard 10GE switch and don't need to uplink most of the traffic.  Part of the issue with the higher speed ethernets is lack of a copper cabling option, particularly one which works with existing cable plants.  (less of a concern within racks).",,rdl,,1365626026,2013-04-10T20:33:46Z,comment,5527959,5525134,,,

There are at least 5 spacecraft under development right now that would need pilots: NASA Orion, Boeing CST, SpaceX Dragon, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic. Even if some of these fold, it still seems likely that at least 2-3 spacecraft would need crews at the same time.

,,"&#62; ... totally confident in the predictions of economic ruin that they don't even bother to explain their reasoning.<p>I don't predict economic ruin -- I predict slower economic growth. It's not the same.<p>What I do think, is that there's a huge moral dilemma when we in the western world who're enjoying the fruits of economic growth are now ready to push much poorer parts of the world into slowing their growth, and thus slowing their ascent to the prosperity we're all but taking for granted.<p>&#62; Why this spurious equation of energy efficiency with a halt to economic development?<p>Energy efficiency is going to advance itself, since efficiency equals money saved. But the kind of energy efficiency sought under the banner of saving the planet has nothing to do with efficiency, and everything to do with forcing us into using less energy at whatever the cost.<p>&#62; Your argument implies that economic development in poor countries must follow the same path that of the west during the industrial revolution<p>Burning fossil fuels is <i>by far</i> the cheapest and easiest way to generate mechanical and electrical energy on demand. Especially when bootstrapping an infrastructure, it's also the most efficient. Gasoline, diesel and oil are simply the only readily available sources of energy that's immediately and cheaply transportable and storable. There is no reason to believe that rural Africa is going to go anywhere without burning a lot of fossils. China and India are sufficiently densely populated and able in terms of infrastructure that they can probably fuel much of their growth electrically -- but barring a breakthrough in nuclear power, there's only so much of it that's going to be generated without fossil-burning.<p>However: That might change, come economic development.<p>Taxing (in whatever way, directly or indirectly) carbon emissions -- and that's really the only political proposal that's on the table will curtail economic growth: It will make it harder for the ""little man"" in China, India, Africa and Russia who can create economic growth by driving his car to the next town, or who can increase yield from his field by using a tractor, or mechanised irrigation pumps, or who tries to run a factory. To hundreds of millions of people there is simply no way of doing these things available, that doesn't involve burning fossils.<p>Since rich countries for this reason will be expected to lead the way, it will also mean that the inventor of something that might change this dynamic, would have a harder time raising the necessary capital. The richer an economic is, the more money it can afford to throw into universities, research and startups.<p>&#62; I've been following (but not crusading for) environmental issues for 20 years<p>Good. Then I'm sure you'll agree it would have been disastrous if humankind had sat down in 1989 and decided to implement a world-wide scheme that would essentially dampen economic growth and development.<p>&#62; We have greatly enhanced our technology over the last 20 years, so why can we not put that expertise to work now, instead of waiting for some future panacea?<p>Because we still don't have a solution that doesn't involve dragging down the world economy. Our solution today is to try to stop doing the things that emit carbon, but as long as those things are also to a large extend the things that create wealth, it has some extremely bad side effects. Wind turbines are fine for up to about 15% of the electrical supply in the developed world. Solar is promising where and when the sun shines. Water plants are fine where are water for them (not many places left, if any). Nuclear is nice, except for the waste and the extremely high requirements for safety (making them slow and expensive to construct and operate).<p>We are getting there, and we have several outs. Electrical cars and hydrogen infrastructure would allow a much higher share of wind and solar in the mix. 3rd gen. biodiesel might help. Efficient scrubbers would allow us to stop caring about coal, oil and gas plants. But we are not there yet.<p>&#62; As for being in better future financial shape, you assume an inevitable upward trend (...) Only a few short years ago the bull market was hailed as a great economic success<p>Energy creates wealth, because it makes the same person more efficient. That's the essence of the industrial revolution: harnessing energy in machines, suddenly one person can create much more. Since then, machines and how we operate them has developed massively in favour of efficiency -- from the steam hammer to Tim Ferris operating business on an iPhone lying on a beach.<p>And we need to look at the economy at a much grander scale than 10 years. Economies expand and contracts, but over a longer time, it invariably expands. When there is talk of global climate change, a scale of 100 years is more appropriate.<p>&#62; To believe that some future market will be so awash in capital as to render environmental improvement a trivial overhead is to subscribe to a form of socioeconomic teleology<p>I'm not claiming that. I'm claiming that it's going to be richer than this one, and not least, more developed than this one. About 120 years ago we worried about the wether the supply of whale oil could meet the demand -- in other words, it seemed unlikely that in the future, the market would be awash (pardon the pun) in whale oil. Then we refined mineral oil, and that was that. Nobody knows what the future holds. The officials going to Copenhagen (which reminds me, I need to find a place out of the city to park my car for those weeks) think they know what the future holds.

,,"My “mindset” (if you can call it that) is that most people don’t get much experience tackling hard problems, at least up through school. In light of that, what I would “advocate” is that people should try to get practice working on problems at their current level of stamina&#x2F;ability (which might be very low), and slowly work their way up, instead of beating themselves up when a problem much more difficult than what they were used to seemed like an impossible challenge.<p>Maybe you can elaborate about what “mindset” you were thinking of, and why it came close to breaking you? I suspect you were misunderstanding my intended message, and that the “mindset” you are imagining is pretty far from my own set of beliefs.<p>Note that before I was not <i>advocating</i> anything; only stating an observation that most people don’t get much practice tackling hard problems, and that people with or without ADHD can have difficulty tackling hard problems. Do you think that is inaccurate? It seems pretty uncontroversial to me. I know a lot of people who have difficulty with hard problems, and some of them definitely don’t have ADHD.<p>* * *<p>I am taking care of a 3.5 year old full time, so I’ll give you some relevant examples from that context:<p>If I try to read a book aloud which is much too hard for him (say a novel pitched at teenagers), he gets bored and wanders away. But his attention span, vocabulary, grammar, etc. are gradually improving, so the books he understands now (e.g. Pippi Longstocking, The Cricket in Times Square) are much more sophisticated than the books he could understand a year ago (e.g. Henry and Mudge, Frog and Toad), which are in turn much more sophisticated than the books he was interested in a year before that (e.g. Go Dog Go, The Very Hungry Caterpillar).<p>If we try to work on some 1-player logic puzzle games, the ones that say “age 7+” on the box are currently too difficult for him and he gets bored&#x2F;frustrated and wants to do something else. The ones that say “age 5+” are pretty good, and he can do them with some external help. The ones that say “age 3+” are getting to be easy by now, and he can do them independently.<p>If we go out to practice balancing on a vehicle, a 2-wheeled scooter is now getting to be okay if we go carefully, but 6 months ago it was too difficult and therefore very frustrating. A year ago, he was just starting to figure out the (pedal-free) balance bike, and now he can zoom around on it. If I tried to get him to ride a skateboard I predict he would fall off and not want to try (heck, that’s probably what <i>I</i> would do if I tried to ride a skateboard).<p>One of my son’s friends has no experience with a balance bike, and is embarrassed to try in front of anyone, because my son (who has more than a year of practice) can zoom all around, whereas any kid just starting finds it to be a great challenge. But the same kid can swing across the monkey bars, something my son cannot, because that’s something that boy has practiced for a few months.<p>* * *<p>Activities like writing computer programs, playing music, writing essays, playing sports, cooking, etc. are similar: they require many challenging skills which must be slowly built up over the course of years of practice, and are very daunting for someone who is unprepared. The way to get better at these is to start at your current level and practice, in a playful and low-pressure environment, slowly improving until you can handle high-level challenges.<p>And the same is true of meta skills which apply to many domains like searching and reading academic literature in a field you are unfamiliar with, coming up with a few choices of high-level problem solving strategies and then picking one to apply, breaking the problem solving process down into smaller manageable chunks until you get down to a chunk small enough to just dive in, taking organized notes, trying many small examples when you don’t yet have a solid conceptual understanding, finding and tackling a simpler related problem instead, stopping occasionally while working to check if you’re making progress and if the current strategy still seems promising, recognizing that you are badly stuck and finding the right person to ask for help ...",,jacobolus,,1587352980,2020-04-20T03:23:00Z,comment,22920855,22920198,,,

,,"Thank you for taking the time to craft such a thoughtful response. Love your feedback. My comments in order below:<p>- I&#x27;m honestly baffled by spending so much time on one book (program?) in a classroom context. I imagine some kids won&#x27;t be interested in the particular story, but it will go on for an entire month. I could see this damaging interest.<p>So the program time is actually 4 active periods on one book. For longer books (higher grades and more difficult Lexile scale will have some extra designated time to ensure students can finish the book but on average it is 4 periods. This includes the watching of episodes, reading out loud, lesson plans that have to be covered as part of ELA (English Language Arts) instruction anyway. High engagement level has been core to our early success but interestingly, one of the main points for improvement from teachers is that our program can feel rushed (ie desire for more designated time). We&#x27;re still working through the kinks :)<p>- The pace seems incredibly slow. To learn to read, you need to read a lot. But this is one book per month?<p>Yup. We only target 9 books ie 1 book per month. Of course, we hope that students would read far more but going from no reading to some reading and carving out &quot;reading time&quot; to develop the <i>habit</i> of reading is where we come into play. Of course schools can and should continue to foster take-home reading and after school or within school time reading outside of this.<p>- The more stories a child is exposed to, the more chances there are to encounter something especially captivating for that child, and to spark an interest.<p>I agree with this.<p>- It&#x27;s hard to believe how much participation there will be without seeing an example class and interactions between the students &amp; actor. The videos on the site make it seem like a completely passive experience.<p>Legally, we cannot share that footage at all.

,,"It is more than just declining government budgets which have caused the decline.  In my opinion, the biggest impediment to corporate R&#38;D is the modern emphasis on quarterly earnings and meeting third-party analysts' estimations thereof.<p>(Warning: idle speculation and arm-chair philosophy ahead)<p>When executive compensation is tied primarily to short term results, it seems inevitable that ""most"" companies will end up being run by those with the most talent and agressive behavior in this area.  Those people are usually bean counters.  Every company needs a bean counter, but only in the last (say) 25 years has it been the norm for every company to be LEAD by one.<p>It is that last point where I think the problem manifests the most.  There is, as everyone at HN knows, a difference between management and leadership.  Leadership requires vision, and no matter how visionary or innovative you are, if your ultimate goal is having a good day at this quarter's earnings call, it's hard to see how you could ever justify investment in something more than a few quarters off.<p>I'm greatly simplifying, of course.  I don't think this happens the way the naive view of this problem proposes: that productive, storied R&#38;D departments are summarily executed at the hands of a new CEO hellbent on meeting his numbers (well, I'm sure that DOES happen sometimes).  Rather, I think what has probably happened to most corporate research is this:<p>- The company is doing well, they're meeting their numbers every quarter and everything is peachy.  Much lip-service is paid to the R&#38;D team ""without whom none of our success would be possible"".<p>- Something happens.  Usually it's a bad economy or a disastrous product launch.  Maybe it's a huge corporate scandal.  Whatever it is, it's worse than just a few quarters of missed estimates.  The stockholders are screaming; the analysts and their puppy dog journalists are holding pitchforks.  The CEO promises that something will be done.  Decisive action will be taken to bring this mess under control.<p>- At first, the R&#38;D departments are spared, because no one wants to ""destroy the golden egg"" (or insert some predictable seed-and-flower metaphor).  But the first round of layoffs in middle management, manufacturing, and engineering aren't enough.  The stock price is still suffering.  Clearly more drastic action is necessary.<p>- But wait a minute, we hear in the boardroom, what about this thing they're doing in R&#38;D that's costing $30 million a year and probably won't produce anything marketable for 20 years, if at all?  I mean, R&#38;D is vital, but surely that stuff is better left to universities and foundations, right?  And just like that, the farthest-looking research project is cut.<p>- It's easy to see how things can proceed in this manner, with every downturn or crisis prompting a cut in the next most distant research project, until suddenly the R&#38;D department is  just the ""Two to Five Year D"" department.  At that point, they get renamed to ""Product Centers"", and are truly and officially subordinated to the management and politics of the quarterly earnings cycle.<p>I spend so much time laying this out because, just as these forward-looking places didn't disappear overnight by some nefarious CEO twisting his or her mustache, so can't they be made to magically reappear at existing corporations through some courageous magnanimous gesture of a new superhero CEO.<p>If you're the new CEO of Yahoo! (a pretty young company when talking about stuff like this), it's probably possible.  But ""Verizon Labs""?  ""P&#38;G Long Term Research""?  I don't think so.  In fact, I predict that even the storied Microsoft Research division will encounter this fate if the company's financial prospects continue to look south.<p>So what will resurrect the tradition of corporate R&#38;D?  I think several things:<p>1. Just as there is a trend toward online distributed learning, so I think will there emerge a trend toward online distributed research.  The Open Source movement is, in a way, the archetype for this (although it is closer to distributed engineering).  With new peer-to-peer open publishing and review systems (of which arXiv is a start), a lessened immediate emphasis on PhD credentials, a desire to mix and match areas of interest out of fun and curiosity, the continually shrinking barrier to entry (with everything from 3D printing to cheaper genomics), and the always-important promise of possible fortunes through startup spinoffs or ""acqui-hires"", it will become more and more common for fundamental research to happen outside the traditional places where it was done before.<p>2.  The larger, more expensive research will still be done at universities and companies, but the companies will be more of the Elon Musk variety.  In fact, I very much hope that he succeeds with Tesla and SolarCity as well as SpaceX, not only because I believe in those underlying visions, but because I think Wall Street and the rest of the world need to see ""altrusitic visionary capitalists"".  Skepticism and cynicism of capitalism in-the-large is at an all-time high, and it will take some larger-than-life personalities with spectacular successes to get those less courageous people and organizations to follow suit.  The ultimate end goal of this should be, among other things, ""the death of the quarterly analyst"" and, hopefully, a deepening of trust in the mechanisms of well-regulated capitalism supported (especially in the technical realms) by open and public-funded foundational research at universities and other institutions.<p>3. Long term, I really believe in the elimination of most physical scarcity.  If you can 3D-print a Ferrari, you might not care as much about stepping on so many toes to get one.  This is, I admit, a hopelessly naive and optimistic look at the future, and to some extent human beings will always compete with one another (it is, in my view, one of the things that make life worth living).  But in a world of post-physical scarcity, things like fundamental research and truly innovative product and service development may become THE things to brag about ""at the club"".<p>One can hope.",,breckinloggins,,1343924179,2012-08-02T16:16:19Z,comment,4329443,4328664,,,

,,"&gt;This myth needs to die.<p>Let me spell it out in an example. Sports. Horse racing or basketball. You have a team of highly skilled players with a bunch of information quantized, including height, weight, score statistics, rebound statistics, biography... etc. And these guys are in a game with a very very controlled set of rules under exactly the same time pressure and everyone still fails to predict the outcome.<p>In software you have a product. The product is usually not concretely defined and you have a complex code base and you can never be 100% sure exactly how the new product will integrate with that code base... you&#x27;re also not 100% sure how the code will be put together to define the product. Additionally are you 100% familiar with the stack? Do you know every possible primitive of psql or ruby or python or C++ that you could be using to create your project because I pretty much guarantee you every basketball player more or less knows every possible move and rule of a basketball game.<p>You&#x27;re also working with a team that includes people that you have much less information on than normal. You worked with a guy for what at most two years does that give you accurate statistical information to the degree of say a basketball player? Also there&#x27;s bound to be people you&#x27;re less familiar with working on the project as well. Are you interacting with other teams as well? Does the outcome of your project hinge on the completion of a feature by an entire team outside of your own?<p>People can be experts on horse races or sports. Even then they can&#x27;t predict things accurately. If you were to start making bets on software development dates of completion. You will also massively fail because not only are there more variables in a software project... but you have much less information.<p>Chaos is a phenomenon that happens to systems we have close to perfect information for. We find that if we have the perfect information of all the particles in a weather system except for say one particle. We find that information about that missing particle will make our mathematical calculation wildly inaccurate.<p>For software we don&#x27;t even have anything close to perfect information in a system with multitudes of variables.

So if I predict a project will take one year I can be off by 3 years under your logic. If I predict a month, than I can be off by 3 months. If I predict a week, 3 weeks. 3x is pretty horrible if you ask me, it&#x27;s easy to make guesses within these parameters.<p>I predict that both a hurricane and an earthquake will happen in a century. I&#x27;ll only be off by 3x or 3 centuries. Actually I can do better than that.

Second there will be a trans-EU judiciary system which allows for injecting change (either through impeachment, imprisonment, or both) into member states leadership. If such a system existed it would have allowed the joint-EU leadership to demand (and get) corrective action on destructive behavior.<p>Those changes will effectively mean handing national soverignty over to a central authority.

,,"I have chosen Go for now, after having learned Nim and Rust. I also know Ada, FreePascal, Racket, CL and a bunch of other languages fairly well. Python was never an option, because it&#x27;s too slow and (subjective opinion) a very ugly language. There were clear reasons why Go was the best choice for me:<p>Pros:
- large infrastructure, many third party libraries
- good tooling
- fast compilation speed
- reasonably fast executables (fast enough)
- (just) good enough GUI bindings - although it almost failed on that one
- automatic garbage collection
Cons:
- lack of generics
- a bit too much verbosity (if err!=nil)
- million dollar mistake<p>Subjective assessment of the other languages (for me, and my type of projects - remember, a programming language is only a tool for a certain purpose):<p>- Nim is a great language, but unfortunately seems to be eternally unready for prime time. Lack of complete enough GUI bindings.<p>- Rust is a convoluted language and has no garbage collection. It is marginally better than Ada at the cost of readability, has a number of minor misfeatures, and an unnecessarily steep learning curve. I predict it to have the same complexity or higher than C++ in ten years from now, with all the disadvantages and security issues this brings. Especially macros are a very, very bad idea. (They also count against Nim in my book.)<p>- D is a very good language and on my list of things to learn. Reasons for deciding against it were primarily its nearness to C++ and the express intent of the developers to get rid of garbage collection in favour of some convoluted, needlessly complex borrow checking. (Unfortunately, D also has macros, but they are less obtrusive and less needed than in Rust.)<p>- C: dev time too slow<p>- C++: dev time too slow, too many pitfalls (even if you use just a subset, at some point you will have to deal with esoteric code and bugs that require 40+ of experience to understand); ugly language.<p>- Kotlin: Java VM is out of question, the long-term technology support on some platforms is too uncertain.<p>- Crystal: issues with multithreading (if I remember correctly), lack of a good enough GUI binding.<p>- Java: out of question - I consider it legacy technology, I&#x27;ve used it in the past and found the frameworks to be horrible (too much OOP); ugly language; future VM support too uncertain on some platforms.<p>- Julia: very nice language, fast; it lacked a good enough GUI binding last time I checked, but once it has one, it will be on my list of things to test.<p>- Zig: interesting but too close to C, no garbage collection, only manual memory management.<p>- FreePascal&#x2F;Lazarus: probably the best GUI support but mostly manual memory management and felt kind of old; basically, I didn&#x27;t choose it for fear of accumulating too much technological debt.<p>- Ada: probably the static language I like the most, has everything I need, but is pretty much dead - not enough third party libraries, single vendor lock-in, only GTK as viable GUI option, fear of accumulating too much technological debt; it&#x27;s a pity, because I think it&#x27;s the best language among those mentioned so far.<p>- Racket: my main language for the past 20 years, I have developed successfully GUI applications with it, large tooling, fast enough, BUT: application startup time too slow, rich text editors too sluggish, GUI slightly too limited, professional deployment can be complicated (by professional I mean with all correct metadata, icons, according to OS guidelines, code signing, sandboxing, etc.), dynamic typing bad.<p>- CommonLisp: probably a good choice for high-tech long-term, large-scale web-based applications like booking systems or scheduling systems; libraries suffer from lack of documentation, executable sizes and memory consumption fairly large, bindings to C&#x2F;C++ libraries notoriously incomplete or undocumented; dynamic typing bad.<p>Okay, that&#x27;s it. These are all purely subjective evaluations for the purpose of writing fun, fast, compact, mid-size cross-platform GUI end-user applications.

,,"Ha. You're kind of outing yourself as a white male with statements like that. I daresay blacks or women would be none too eager to join you in your idyllic 1800s paradise. There is something to be said for the simple life on the land, though for me I'll keep my A380s, internet and penicillin, thanks.<p>I like your point about ""be careful what you wish for"". America was certainly left holding the bag all right, and perhaps it took a long time to sink in the reasons that the Europeans had been so eager to hand it over. Truth is, no one country should be holding that bag, which is why a proper UN (not necessarily the UN we have today) is so desirable and inevitable. Hopefully the USA, realising that playing the role of global policeman is not the fun career it envisaged in its youth, will come to realise that a supranational pseudo-government is actually a very good idea. I predict this ""realisation"" will occur right about the time China overtakes the USA as the world's pre-eminent nation, in perhaps 20 or 30 years' time.<p>Well, like I said, the Iraq question is a very, very dead horse by now. The American opinion might have something to do with WMDs and UN Resolutions and what not, but the rest of the world has pretty much decided Iraq was pretty much just a 9/11 scapegoat and would never have been attacked absent the WTC incident. Argue if you want but there's not much point - I was explaining a sentiment, not trying to defend it. Anyway my own country was right there beside you, so not like I can point fingers. Folly on your part was also folly on my part. Ah well. Lessons learnt, hopefully.<p>Well, regarding the world stage - I don't think France or Australia are the peers you're looking for. France is 1/5th the size of the USA and Australia, 1/15th the size! Not really on the same level.<p>America's natural peers are the EU, India, China, ASEAN, CAFTA, CIS, and other blocs. America, too, will subsume into a bloc (NAFTA or successor), in time. I really see this process as inevitable. Hopefully we'll arrive fairly soon at a point where we have 10 or so major blocs sitting around a table, almost like elected officials representing their electorate, and they can duke out this kind of stuff with real authority and the power to back up their words. Not there yet, but it's a hope.<p>One more thing - don't bank on China's political system collapsing anytime soon. It won't. It's not even that bad, really. Communism is practically gone and if anything the country as everyday people experience it is now even more capitalist than America. They have even been experimenting with local elections, though not called by that name. Give them a few more years and I wouldn't have any problem living in China.

,,"&gt; And, while it is also worth considering whether the impending merger between Comcast and Time Warner cable might exacerbate the current situation, I predict that this is unlikely.  In general, as one access ISP gains more market share, a content provider such as Netflix depends on connectivity to that ISP even more, potentially extracting increasingly higher prices for interconnection.  In the specific case of Comcast and Time Warner, it is difficult to predict exactly how much additional leverage this will create, but as it turns out, these two ISPs are already in markets where they are not competing with one another, so this specific merger is unlikely to dramatically change the current situation.<p>I&#x27;m having trouble with this logic.

,,"I do not believe they are arguing for a soul but rather just pragmatism. It&#x27;s not that “measurement” has some special status as coming from a soul or something: indeed your unwillingness to see it as a normal thing that happens, such that you immediately jump to this question, indicates that you have already “drunk the Kool-Aid.”<p>This is more clear in Everett&#x27;s original formulation. Everett didn&#x27;t speak of “many worlds” but of a difference between relative and absolute truth. You measure a spin-½ particle along some axis, it is only “relatively” true that you saw what you saw, say ↑, and there is also a relative truth that you saw ↓. But because these relative truths are exhaustive there is also an absolute truth that you have the deluded belief that you saw either one or the other; that truth holds in both relative truths. The “lost contact” objection is precisely that in Everett&#x27;s theory this belief <i>is</i> ultimately delusional (there is nothing like collapse to which they correspond, it is just formally incorrect to confuse your relative truths with the absolute truths) and we are led by the theory to delusions like this “with high probability” (scare quotes because Everett realized more so than his successors that eliminating collapse also untethers the theory from probability in a deep way). It is just accepted that these deeply practical things like “my existence as an observer” and “my tool’s measurements” are ultimately based on a sort of illusion which has no correspondence to the true reality; this is buried in a mathematical technicality in his thesis (he notes that he is not looking for an “isomorphism” between experience and the external world, but a “homomorphism”), but it is kind of the crux of the whole enterprise. “It’s fine if I predict things which are not observed, so long as I also predict the things that are observed and I predict that you will be very opinionated about not observing the things predicted but not observed,” if you will, is the homomorphic approach to QM that Everett advocates.<p>In that respect there is something very different from “the history of physics.” Physics does in some cases say that certain things are illusions. And those statements track very closely with MWI. For example a rainbow appears to be a thing out in the world, but modern physics is very happy to say that the phenomenon cannot be correctly located as an object inside the cloud in which it is perceived, because it turns out the cloud is “rainbowing” in different ways in many different directions and you are only getting part of the story. You see part of the light suggesting a reconstruction of a physical object, but if we look at all of the light we realize that the different reconstructions are not reconcilable because they all have to occur at a 41° angle from the rays of the Sun and real objects have varying angles.<p>You can see a lot of similar ground trod here. Both claims of illusion appeal to the act of trying to reconstruct the external world from observed experience. Both then appeal to looking at all observations taken together. But there is a difference in scope. In the rainbow case there is a counterfactual, a “what you would have seen,” that can be confirmed with a camera at some other location. We can do a parallax measurement to reconstruct that the rainbow is actually around as far away from you as the Earth is from the Sun or so. But in MWI these sorts of experiments which may be possible are ultimately forever infeasible, I need to have quantum control of every atom of my measurement apparatus if I want to make some similar observation, and even then any particular observation will be consistent with a classical ontology, it&#x27;s just the pattern of many observations which will suggest non-local correlations which I can interpret as evidence for maybe everything being illusory. One rocks your boat gently, the other is sailing in a hurricane.",,crdrost,,1599310143,2020-09-05T12:49:03Z,comment,24383151,24382631,,,

I put some thought into my comment, and it&#x27;s provoked some discussion.<p>Let me provoke some more: I predict that, by the end of this year, the number of total deaths in people over 85 will be about the same as last year.<p>I&#x27;m using the fact that most deaths from this virus occur in people who are already ill from other conditions.  Frail old people are much more vulnerable to succumbing to infections.<p>Last year, about 13.5% of people over age 85 in the USA died [1].  That high death rate means that, at some point in the year, 13.5% of those people fell very ill, and had only months to live.  This year, without the pandemic, a similar proportion of people would be close to death.  If they caught the virus that causes covid-19, their death would be hastened.  However, they would have died anyway, this year.<p>I know it&#x27;s callous to say &quot;they would have died anyway,&quot; since death is a terrible thing.  However, humans have a limited lifespan, for some mysterious reason, and at some point our bodies start to betray us: we develop heart disease or cancer, and our immune systems become less effective.  It&#x27;s as if our bodies are lowering their defenses, almost inviting death.  Often, along comes a flu, to finish the job.  This year&#x27;s angel of death is a different respiratory virus, not influenza.<p>1. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;products&#x2F;databriefs&#x2F;db355.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;products&#x2F;databriefs&#x2F;db355.htm</a>",,alejohausner,,1588194494,2020-04-29T21:08:14Z,comment,23024318,23023896,,,

,,"Let's say a terrorist had a plastic container with a wirelessly detonatable bomb inside surgically implanted in his abdomen. After a few weeks to allow the incision to heal, the guy went through airport security.  Given the number of implantable devices on the market, I bet the TSA folks are quite used to feeling the odd lumps of pacemakers, etc. on people's torsos.  While the backscatter xrays might show a bunch of wires and such, would the image look much different than someone who had a pacemaker implanted with various leads into the heart?  What if that guy was rubbed down with the bomb detection cloth pad (name?) which is then placed in the explosives detector?  After a few weeks of being sewn up, would he trigger an alarm?<p>What's interesting about this scheme is that the bomb would be ready-to-go, and the terrorist could throw himself right before hitting his remote control button toward the area of the plane deemed to maximize the likelihood of death.<p>Is this scenario at all possible?  How could the TSA possibly deal with it without harassing a bunch of people with pacemakers installed?  If a single terrorist tries such a scheme, I predict that everyone with any sort of implanted object will have be added to some sort of pre-screening registry so the TSA can sort-of verify the legitimacy of the thing which shows-up on xray/pat-downs/etc.<p>As is obvious to most HN readers, the TSA's security measures can only make it more difficult for terrorists to operate.

,,"I think tankers will still work, but the problem has to be attacked from a different angle.<p>California&#x27;s water is a repayment on the bond measure for building it&#x27;s infrastructure back in the 60s. It&#x27;s somewhere around 80% of the price of water. This is the largest reason for it&#x27;s seemingly fixed cost and relative cheapness, even during the drought years. Under these circumstances a single tanker is simply a drop in the proverbial bucket.<p>What California&#x27;s drought hurts is the entire state&#x27;s total water carrying capacity year over year. Once that reaches a critical low, California will be spurred to take another water bond project of equal size. I predict this will fund desalinization plants along the coast.<p>Looking at the problem from this perspective, I&#x27;m estimating how much water is produced daily by a given plant. The question then becomes &quot;Can I produce as much water as this plant for less money (loan&#x2F;maintenance&#x2F;electricity)?&quot; I imagine this requires a dozen such tankers <i>each day</i> in Los Angeles harbor, each selling at half the cost per gallon.<p>Now this might be impossible to engineer cost wise because of the very math you mentioned.

,,"&gt;Personally, I predict that they&#x27;ll need to either give up on service revenue growth, or roll back on these changes.<p>There is no need to give up on service revenue. Before 2016, my expectation of future Apple Services was growth from AppleCare and iCloud. Today, Apple put $10 per devices to services revenue for OS, Map and other Software. Apple could hike the price and move those to services. For example iPhone price hike but with 2 years AppleCare by default.<p>Nearly 80% of App Store revenue are from Gaming. There is no reason why Apple cant separate Game into a different Store and continue to charge 30% off it. That would have protected 80% of App Store revenue alone. EPIC wouldn&#x27;t be happy, but I am sure most people couldn&#x27;t care less. Gaming are not the fabric of our modern society ( I am sure there will be people who disagree ).<p>Then it is the Apps and Services. Which is not only just a revenue problem but a power play problem.

,,"I am an American living in Indonesia at the moment.<p>A lot of this is complicated.  The US, as the only superpower (financial, cultural, and military) is not just one country among many.  What happens in the US affects every corner of the planet.  I am living right now in Indonesia and I see that every day.  There are other countries which this can be said for, but they all are oil exporters and their impact is solely a function of those oil exports.<p>At the same time, I find a lot of Americans seem to think the other countries don't matter as much as they do.  Consequently we have these bizarre discussions of how anti-American one country or another is, and, absent them calling America the great Satan or the like, one wonders how much of it is being intolerant of a level of dissent in foreign countries that would be perfectly allowed at home.<p>So the truth is very often more complicated than simple dichotomies.<p>The exception is that I would agree with #4.  The US has a number of huge looming challenges which affect our country in a way no other country is affected.  These include what I call ""peak oil"" (see below, not quite what peak oil theorists mean), the baby boomer retirement (this affects us differently than China or Japan, but Europe is going to feel the effects too), and a need to repair/replace much of our existing infrastructure.  The infrastructure disrepair is becoming evident now, but I want to spend more time on the others.<p>Peak oil is usually defined as an absolute peak in production, after which production cannot rise to the same level.  This is not what I mean.  Instead I mean peak production relative to demand.  We passed this peak in 1973 and after the oil crisis, oil supply never continued to grow in the way it grew prior to 1973.  The crisis itself may have been political and the peak may be economic, but that doesn't make it any less real.  Since 1973, oil production has gone up and down, but never continued to grow steadily as it had in the past.<p>Oil makes our economy work because it is a cheap source of energy.  Unconventional hydrocarbons can help there, but they take much more energy to extract, and thus when energy is the limiting principle of your economy (and thus the primary cost), these are only profitable at high oil prices.  Unconventional hydrocarbons thus act as a cushion against the sort of drastic decline we might see if we were only looking at light sweet crude.  They are not a perfect substitute.  And so I predict that oil production to the extent it increases, will not do so as fast as demand, and thus energy prices will continue to rise.  The key driver of this demand is economic development in China, Brazil, India, and other countries.  And thus any increase in production will not cause a collapse in oil or energy prices.  Also note that most renewable energy has a comparatively low energy return on investment and so they are only really profitable when oil prices are high also, so they too act as a cushion.  A transition from stored solar energy (fossil fuels) to current solar energy will not be economically pleasant.<p>The problem here is that higher energy prices, particularly oil prices, puts the brakes on all aspects of the economy and the US is particularly vulnerable.  The US may already be past peak oil consumption as oil consumption has been falling off in recent years (how much is due to the Great Recession is hard to know however).<p>Retirement also affects different places differently.  Europe and the US are likely to be hardest hit by the baby boom retiring, but the US is particularly vulnerable.  In most countries in the world, retirement is not expected to be independent.  When you retire, you move in with your kids, and help them raise their kids.  They pay for your medical bills, and feed you, and you help them out as you can.  In Europe and the US this is different.  The expectation that we will have independent retirement means we have to save up vast amounts of money for that, and we also have to have programs like Medicare to provide the costs for caring for the elderly.  However, the US is uniquely bad at cost control.  Our public sector pays more per capita on medical care than any other country in the world and that's just the public sector (Medicare, Medicaid, the VA, and state/federal gov. insurance pools).  We can't control costs there and so the costs will be truly hard to bear.  Entirely missing in the health care reform debate has been this incompetence of the federal government to control costs in any way.<p>The US has one significant advantage in all this but it is one that could go away suddenly and leave us stranded.  The USD is the world's reserve currency.  This means that the national debt can be eased by the US essentially printing money to get out of debt.  However, if that changes, the US access to international credit will suddenly be very different and our debt will become difficult to sustain.  Right now we are lucky because there are no real alternatives.  The Euro was looking good for a while, but not anymore.....<p>tl; dr:  The US has a number of significant and unique challenges which will erode our presence in the world over coming decades.

The LiDAR sensors are often used to generate detailed maps of the immediate surroundings such as pedestrians, speed breakers, dividers, and other vehicles. Its ability to create a three-dimensional image is one of the reasons why most automakers are keenly interested in developing this technology with the sole exception of the famous automaker Tesla. Tesla&#x27;s self-driving cars rely on RADAR technology as the primary sensor.</i><p>&gt; <i>High-end LiDAR sensors can identify the details of a few centimeters at more than 100 meters. For example, Waymo&#x27;s LiDAR system not only detects pedestrians but it can also tell which direction they’re facing. Thus, the autonomous vehicle can accurately predict where the pedestrian will walk. The high-level of accuracy also allows it to see details such as a cyclist waving to let you pass, two football fields away while driving at full speed with incredible accuracy. Waymo has also managed to cut the price of LiDAR sensors by almost 90% in the recent years. A single unit with a price tag of $75,000 a few years ago will now cost just $7,500, making this technology affordable.</i><p>&gt; <i>However, this technology also comes with a few distinct disadvantages. The LiDAR system can readily detect objects located in the range of 30 meters to 200 meters. But, when it comes to identifying objects in the vicinity, the system is a big letdown. It works well in all light conditions, but the performance starts to dwindle in the snow, fog, rain, and dusty weather conditions. It also provides a poor optical recognition. That’s why, self-driving car manufacturers such as Google often use LIDAR along with secondary sensors such as cameras and ultrasonic sensors.</i><p>&gt; <i>The RADAR system, on the other hand, is relatively less expensive. Cost is one of the reasons why Tesla has chosen this technology over LiDAR. It also works equally well in all weather conditions such as fog, rain, and snow, and dust. However, it is less angularly accurate than LiDAR as it loses the sight of the target vehicle on curves. It may get confused if multiple objects are placed very close to each other. For example, it may consider two small cars in the vicinity as one large vehicle and send wrong proximity signal. Unlike the LiDAR system, RADAR can determine relative traffic speed or the velocity of a moving object accurately using the Doppler frequency shift.</i><p>&gt; <i>Though Tesla has been heavily criticized for using RADAR as the primary sensor, it has managed to improve the processing capabilities of its primary sensor allowing it to see through heavy rain, fog, dust, and even a car in front of it. However, besides the primary RADAR sensor, the new Tesla vehicles will also have 8 cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and the new onboard computing system. In other words, both technologies work best when used in combination with cameras and ultrasonic sensors.</i><p>LiDAR and depth detection will be needed, no matter how good the pure computer vision solutions get.<p>The accidents with Teslas were the Autopilot running into large trucks with white trailers that blended with the sky so it just rammed into it thinking it was all sky. LiDAR would have been able to tell distance and dimension which would have solved those issues.<p>[Even the most recent crash where the Tesla hit an overturned truck would have been not a problem with LiDAR](<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;california&#x2F;story&#x2F;2021-05-16&#x2F;tesla-driver-in-fatal-california-crash-had-post-videos-of-himself-in-vehicle"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;california&#x2F;story&#x2F;2021-05-16&#x2F;tesla-dr...</a>). If you ask me sonar, radar and cameras are not enough, just cameras is dangerous.<p>Eventually I think either Tesla will have to have all these or regulations will require LiDAR in addition to other tools like sonar&#x2F;radar if desired and cameras&#x2F;sensors of all current types and more. LiDAR when it is cheaper will get more points almost like Kinect and each iteration of that will be safer and more like how humans see. The point cloud tools on iPhone Pro&#x2F;Max are a good example of how nice it is.<p>Human distance detection is closer to LiDAR than RADAR.  We can easily tell when something is far in the distance and to worry or not about it.  We can easily detect the sky from a diesel trailer even when they are the same colors.  That is the problem with RADAR only, it can be confused by those things due to detail and dimension especially on turns like the stop sign one is. We don&#x27;t shoot out RADAR or lasers to check distance but we innately understand distance with just a glance not just from vision alone though.<p>Humans can be tricked by distance but as we move the dimension and distance becomes more clear, that is exactly LiDARs best feature and RADARs&#x2F;CV trouble spot, it isn&#x27;t as good on turning or moving distance detection.  LiDAR was built for that, that is why point clouds are easy to make with it as you move around.  LiDAR and humans learn more as they move around or look around. RADAR can actually be a bit confused by that.  LiDAR also has more resolution far away, it can see more detail far beyond human vision.<p>I think in the end on self-driving cars we&#x27;ll see BOTH LiDAR and RADAR but at least LiDAR in addition to computer vision, they both have pros and cons but LiDAR is by far better at quick distance checks for items further out. This stop sign would be no issue for LiDAR. It really just became economical in terms of using it so it will come down in price and I predict eventually Tesla will also have to use LiDAR in addition.<p>[Here&#x27;s an example of where RADAR&#x2F;cameras were jumpy and caused an accident around the Tesla](<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;BnbJvUwbewc?t=262"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;BnbJvUwbewc?t=262</a>), it safely avoids it but causes traffic around to react and results in an accident. The Tesla changed lanes and then hit the brakes, the car behind was expecting it to keep going, then crash.... dangerous. With LiDAR this would not have been as blocky detection, it would be more precise and not such a dramatic slow down.<p>Until Tesla has LiDAR it will continue to be confused with things like this: [TESLA AUTOPILOT MISTAKES MOON FOR YELLOW TRAFFIC LIGHT](<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futurism.com&#x2F;the-byte&#x2F;tesla-autopilot-mistakes-moon-traffic-light"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futurism.com&#x2F;the-byte&#x2F;tesla-autopilot-mistakes-moon-...</a>) and this: [WATCH TESLA’S FULL SELF-DRIVING MODE STEER TOWARD ONCOMING HIGHWAY TRAFFIC](<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futurism.com&#x2F;the-byte&#x2F;watch-tesla-self-driving-steer-toward-oncoming-highway-traffic"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futurism.com&#x2F;the-byte&#x2F;watch-tesla-self-driving-steer...</a>).

There&#x27;s a difference between the productive economy and the speculative economy. The productive economy is based around changes in the material world. The speculative economy is based around opinions. Stock markets are effectively opinion poll trackers (opinions either baked into mathematical models or in the heads of traders).<p>It&#x27;s no surprise that the pound dropped after the Brexit result, because we&#x27;re looking at a period of uncertainty, which makes predictions harder and traders more risk averse.<p>However, in the productive economy in the same time period, there hasn&#x27;t been an 80% drop in the output of the real economy. The jobs market is still strong, people still produce roughly the same level of goods and services as they did a year ago, etc...<p>What I predict will happen after the period of uncertainty ends is that opinions will catch up to reality and traders will realise their models of economic output were out, leading to a readjustment in the stock markets.<p>The problem is, as people have gotten so hysterical about Brexit, the period of uncertainty will probably last longer than it should, and this loss of confidence can have an impact on the productive economy over time. That&#x27;s my main concern over Brexit, that it&#x27;ll be the reaction to it that causes a longer economic downturn than is necessary. My only hope with this is linked to more people becoming adept at seeing through the mechanisms of the UK&#x27;s toxic media institutions.",,ZenoArrow,,1500209934,2017-07-16T12:58:54Z,comment,14781789,14781178,,,

,,"It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that sales and development have substantially different work cycles. A sales is a binary event, once it&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s done. Development on the other hand is (mostly) never complete. There&#x27;s maintainence to do, features to tweak, bugs to fix and so on.<p>Let&#x27;s consider a bug report. Let&#x27;s assume the client is not paying to get the bug fixed. Which developer then wants the job? Indeed since programmers are incentivized the same way as Sales, they need to &quot;complete&quot; lots of jobs quickly. The faster the better. Which leads to more corners being cut in the first place. Worse code, no-one interested in maintainence - these are not recipes for quality products.<p>One of the bigger problems with commission based salesman is they they&#x27;ll sell <i>anything</i> - limiting them to selling only what is already available takes strong management, and the occasional waving of a big stick. Our sales people work inside some tight constraints and are financially penalized when they oversell. This is a reaction to past sales people overselling, angering their commission, but for work which was ultimately unprofitable because they mis-sold the client the wrong product.<p>Culturally sales people are used to a commission -programmers are not. Sales people sell a lot of things that are eh to sell, and avoid products that are worthwhile, but hard to sell.

,,"You wrote:  <i>For example if you say in a free market people consent to respect their property rights, I would say these people form a ""government"" and have thus defined government rules.</i><p>I define a government as a group of people who have a monopoly of force in a given territorial region.  Such monopolies are very dangerous and often inimical to property rights.  The very people who claim to defend property typically become the worst aggressors against it.  Specifically, my own property is far more vulnerable to seizure by government employees than by ordinary burglars.<p>I'm sorry if that sounds like anti-government propaganda, but it's the simple paintful truth of history and the current moment.<p>Ideally, people institute governments for the purpose of <i>protecting</i> individual life and property, but it just doesn't turn out that way.  After all, human beings are at the helm of such force monopolies, and it's generally unwise to trust human beings with that much power.<p>You wrote: <i>I am not sure if your definition of free market is really workable in practice (no coercion, people just respect each other etc.).</i><p>On the contrary, the non-initiation of aggression works <i>everywhere</i> that it is tried, all the time.  It happens billions of times per day, in homes, stores, and businesses all over the globe.  It is the <i>norm</i> -- so common that it goes unnoticed and unremarked.  Aggression and force are the exceptions, the deviations from the norm.<p>You wrote:  <i>So let me just ask again what I asked in another comment: are there cases in history where free markets have resolved a tragedy of the commons situation?</i><p>In a free market with strong property rights, there are no commons.  The tragedy of the commons arises where there are no clearly defined property rights.<p>To answer your question directly:  yes.  One example is the elephant population in Africa.  In areas without property rights, poaching abounds and the elephant population is decimated.  In areas with property rights, elephant populations triple.  There's no magic involved, and it happens for a simple reason:  property owners <i>want</i> lots of elephants to live on their property.  Wouldn't you?  You might say that the ""dirty little secret"" is that these property owners sell hunting licenses for $50K a pop to Teddy Roosevelt types to go in and bag some big game.  But what's so dirty about it if <i>fewer</i> elephants are killed and <i>more</i> elephants are born?  Do you want elephants or don't you?  ;)<p>You wrote: ""That was the original claim as I understood it: just let the markets run their course, and they'll fix the world's problems.""<p>I would rephrase that.  Just let <i>people</i> run their course without initiating aggression against each other, and they will fix the world's problems.  And when I put it that way, it seems obviously and trivially true.  But that is the definition of a free market after all, so it's not just a word game.<p>You might say that free markets are not ""workable"" because very few people will behave that way.  But as I point out, most people refrain from aggression against other people's property most of the time.  It's the norm.  Theft, murder, and rape are very rare and uncommon occurrences.  They only seem common because they get so much attention when they do occur.<p>You wrote: <i>villagers letting their sheep ruin the common grazing grounds. The solution was to set up fences, that is change the property rules - in my view a government intervention, not an achievement of the market</i><p>Not at all.  Those are achievements of free people trying their best to minimize conflict.  People don't like conflict and will try to minimize it on their own.  I suggest you read ""The Voluntary City"" for some historical examples of people doing amazing things, seemingly impossible in this day and age, without the ""magic"" of government, a.k.a. unilateral force and aggression against other people.  They even managed to build <i>roads</i> of all things -- the favorite example trotted out now as something only government can do.  And they weren't toll roads either.  Hard to imagine now, but it's so obvious when you see how they did it.<p>Common sheep grazing lands, and common fishing areas in the ocean, are all prime examples of tragedy of the commons.  Where there are no property rights, there is no motivation to preserve what's there.  It's just one giant ugly grab, indistinguishable from looting.<p>Perhaps you are arguing that <i>only</i> governments are capable of defending property rights, since only governments have the sufficient force to do so.  That's what Ayn Rand thought, and I think she's wrong about that.  I don't need to get into an argument about guns here, and here's why:  guns are a <i>last resort</i> when it comes to defending life and property.  Free and uncoerced people will try all sorts of things to avoid coming to that point.  Sociopaths don't care, but they are rare.  Most people will go to great lengths to maintain their reputation, which is why arbitration is so often effective.<p>I'm not going to address CO2 certificates, because to me that represents an externality that is extremely difficult to define in terms of specific offenders and victims.  CO2 is one of those things that animals must produce in order to survive.  I do think that the ""free market"", which again means any group of individuals interacting solely by mutual consent, are fully capable of dealing with any threat there.  Consider the vast changes in awareness of environmental issues over the last few decades.  Hell, these days it's <i>uncool</i> to throw cans in the trash and to waste energy.  This is social pressure, not the threat of physical force.<p>More people need to get more wealthy so they can afford a clean environment.  Poor people scrabbling in the dirt cannot afford to think about it.  And I predict that as the Chinese become more capitalized, they will innovate in manufacturing and energy production to reduce emissions of all sorts.  There's a simple reason for that.  Producing waste requires <i>energy</i>, and energy costs money.  But without capital, you cannot afford the innovation at the margin to clean up the processes.<p>Is the free market magic?  Will it lead to the Kingdom of God on earth?  Hell no.  But I am sick of hearing people extol the virtues of force monopolies, and how if they don't apply the lash, nobody will ever do anything right or worthwhile.

Anything related to the nest will require no entry to the house itself, as we want it to be a completely independent space.<p>When it comes to encouraging the home owner to repurpose their garage, a lot of it will have to do with how our first nest does.  If I assume a 50% occupancy rate for our first nest which is open 12 hours a day (fairly conservative in my opinion), that would yield over $120 of revenue per square foot, which would more than pique people’s interest to do something with a garage that’s just collecting dust.  I also plan on splitting the costs of the reservation with the home-owner (specific %s have not been figured out yet), and also sharing the revenue with them as well.  The cost of renovating a garage is actually not as high as you would think because it’s not a functional living space (for example, the cement floor of a garage can be left as is); I predict the average cost of a renovation would be &lt; $8k.<p>The current price point is at $20-25 hour for the space, which would make it the most affordable, private creative space you can currently find in Los Angeles (that is also inspiring and beautiful as well!).",,LYeo,,1460157479,2016-04-08T23:17:59Z,comment,11458897,11457112,,,

That&#x27;s my background.<p>Sorry, that was my mistake.  I didn&#x27;t expect that someone knowledgeable would say the Legendre transform &quot;doesn&#x27;t really show up in quantum mechanics&quot;.  Even if you want to dispute whether the switch between Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of quantum mechanics is truly a Legendre transform, rather than a generalization that doesn&#x27;t deserve that name, it seems incumbent on you to state clearly that this was your (semantical) argument rather than pretending that this was obvious.<p>I don&#x27;t know how a better way to &quot;objectively&quot; establish this than just to Google &quot;path integral legendre transform&quot;; the first hit is arXiv:1612.00462 (in a respectable journal by respectable authors, etc.) whose first sentence is &quot;Legendre transforms play important roles in quantum field theory&quot; before going on to review their central role in the divergence issues that appear immediately when you introduce perturbative expansions in QFT.  Neither of us care about this random paper, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem reasonable to dismiss Legendre transforms as not really showing up without further qualification.<p>Anyways, that was just to explain my mistaken assumption about your background.  Nonetheless, I do apologize as I should have been more careful.  I didn&#x27;t mean to cause offense.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re mistakenly equating Legendre transform to Lagrangian, and basically saying &quot;there is Legendre transform in quantum mechanics because there&#x27;s Lagrangian&quot;<p>No, I&#x27;m saying that if you have the same quantum system (including field theories) that you can treat in the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations, the connection between them makes use of the Legendre transform.<p>&gt; And no, saying no isn&#x27;t a &quot;technical mistake&quot;.<p>Now that I understand better what you were trying to say, I withdraw that language with apologies.  I still think you&#x27;re mistaken, but it&#x27;s about aesthetics, semantics, and pedagogy rather technical assertions.<p>&gt; First, when building theories from symmetries, you typically start from a Lagrangian as the fundamental quantity, as opposed to taking the Legendre transform of something.<p>It&#x27;s certainly true that we can build field-theoretic Lagrangians from symmetries and calculate important quantities without touching a Legendre transform.  But the same can be said about classical mechanics, and it doesn&#x27;t mean the Legendre transform doesn&#x27;t have a central organizing role in our body of knowledge.<p>&gt; Second, when strictly doing quantum mechanics, Legendre transform itself doesn&#x27;t make any sense because everything is an operator. ... Thinking that ordinary Legendre transform will just work in quantum mechanics is naive and plain wrong.<p>I definitely did not suggest that one could do a Legendre transform of operators as if they were commuting variables.  But saying that the Legendre transform doesn&#x27;t play a role in quantum systems for that reason is like saying Maxwell&#x27;s equations don&#x27;t play a role in QED because E and B are commuting variables in Maxwell&#x27;s equations.<p>&gt; Path integrals don&#x27;t have anything to do with relativity, they work perfectly fine for non-relativistic QM as well.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m well aware.   The reason I parenthetically asked &quot;Or maybe you just haven&#x27;t used quantum mechanics outside of the non-relativistic domain...?&quot; is because most students first use it in a relativistic QFT course (rather than just <i>seeing</i> it in Sakurai).  I should have said &quot;field-theoretic context&quot; to be clearer, although of course you can use them even without fields.<p>&gt; And no, you don&#x27;t need path integrals for doing relativistic QM&#x2F;QFT either.<p>Sure, you can do some QM&#x2F;QFT without path integrals just like you can do classical mechanics solely in the Lagrangian framework or solely in the Hamiltonian framework.  But, unlike classical mechanics and unlike quantum field theories where there is a larger diversity of techniques, non-relativistic QM with a finite number of degrees of freedom is usually done solely in the Hamiltonian framework, so people rarely think about the connection to Lagrangians.<p>&gt; There are third and fourth and other formulations of mechanics (Louville theorem, Hamilton-Jacobi equation, ...). You&#x27;re just dismissive about them because they don&#x27;t serve your narrative.<p>Louville&#x27;s theorem is a result within Hamiltonian mechanics.  I&#x27;ve never heard anyone suggest that it&#x27;s a distinct formulation&#x2F;framework, and I&#x27;m honestly confused as to what you could mean by this.  Can you explain your viewpoint more, or point me toward somewhere where I could read more about it?<p>(Or do you just mean using Louville&#x27;s equation to evolve a probability distributions over phase space rather than Hamilton&#x27;s equation to evolve individual phase-space points?  This is no less Hamiltonian mechanics than probabilistic Turing machines are Turing machines.)<p>Whether the Hamilton-Jacobi equation qualifies as a similarly fundamental formulation as the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian formulations is at least an arguable assertion, although one I certainly disagree with.  (Recall my &quot;remotely similar importance&quot; criteria.)  I&#x27;d be happy to debate you on this, but it sounds like you&#x27;re mostly uninterested in aestetic&#x2F;ontological questions, e.g., what makes a formulation qualify as &quot;fundamental&quot;.  That&#x27;s fine, you don&#x27;t have to care about those debates to do good science, but that&#x27;s the nature of our disagreement here, and I think you would need to address it before saying I&#x27;m just trying to serve my narrative.  (Honestly, what ulterior purpose do you think I have?  Scoring fake internet point by writing blog post rants?)<p>&gt; Hand &amp; Finch reads perfectly fine to me, everything is there,<p>I previously suggested that you quote the parts you think are clear, as I have quoted the parts I think are confused in other books.  (Since you&#x27;re the one who thinks it&#x27;s explained well in Hand &amp; Finch, it makes a lot more sense for you to quote the relevant section where you think that happens than for me to quote all the sections where I think it doesn&#x27;t.)  You can certainly dismiss this exercise as not worth your time, but I can&#x27;t really engage with you on this because you&#x27;re just asserting the same thing as your first comment, not actually gathering evidence for it.<p>&quot;Reads perfectly fine to me&quot;, a professor, is not a good criterion for deciding which books do a good job of explaining to students.  Curse of knowledge and all that.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s not &quot;encoded&quot;, you just need to read the equation and the text. There will always be confused students, even if you spell everything out.<p>I&#x27;m not saying treatments like Hand &amp; Finch are bad because some confused students exist, I&#x27;m saying they&#x27;re bad because most students remain confused and better, much-less-confusing treatments are possible.  I challenged you to <i>compare</i> my explanation to Hand &amp; Finch&#x27;s by seeing which is actually understood more by students.<p>To be concrete, I predict that less than 20% of any class of undergraduate students (e.g., Princeton, where I took Hand &amp; Finch with confused classmates) will be able to correctly report that two functions are each other&#x27;s Legendre transforms when their derivatives are inverses.  (If you think that sort of failure rate is just par for the course, then I think we have very different teaching standards and there&#x27;s not much more to discuss.)<p>Before I wrote the blog post, I surveyed two active research faculty and three postdocs and none knew this fact.  I similarly challenge you to ask your colleagues to explain the Legendre transform on the spot and see the fraction of them that can say something more rigorous than H = pv - L.<p>&gt;  I personally have better things to do than dwelling on mysteries of Legendre transform, or deep meanings and magical connections of the number pi.<p>If you haven&#x27;t spent any time thinking about it, wouldn&#x27;t it be better to just not have an opinion one way or the other?  &quot;The Legendre transform isn&#x27;t deep&quot; is a very different assertion to &quot;it&#x27;s pointless to worry which parts of physics are the deepest&quot;.<p>Regardless, I think you&#x27;re making a mistake that ultimately will have a small but non-trivial negative impact on your students.",,jessriedel,,1557076667,2019-05-05T17:17:47Z,comment,19833794,19824160,,,

,,"&gt; If the article is correct that water will become more valuable than oil...<p>Yep, your skepticism is warranted. This is unlikely in the US for common infrastructures, in the large scale, over a long (next generation) period, for standard municipal water (still an under-recognized engineering achievement IMHO). Potable and crop&#x2F;livestock waters (the kinds that civilizations rely upon) are to a first approximation a derivative of energy. Whether to purify it, or move it, water relies heavily upon energy to enter the market.<p>To postulate that a barrel of American-municipal-standard potable water will cost more than a barrel of oil is to hypothesize a situation where it takes more than a barrel of oil to create a barrel of that kind of water. Now note I put in the qualifier &quot;for common infrastructures&quot;. That&#x27;s key.<p>If you have a large enough logistical tail behind creating that barrel of potable water, then it absolutely will cost more than a barrel of oil. For example, that will easily be the case when comparing a barrel of WTI pulled from a stripper well against a barrel of potable water created on a US Navy ballistic missile submarine, including all decomm costs amortized in on both the well and the submarine.<p>On a slightly less fantastical plane, that qualifier can likely be breached (pun intended) if sea levels do actually rise faster than we can revamp our coastal infrastructures. Major metro water processing plants and the supply chains feeding them are complex beasts, and they are multi-year projects even when money is no object and working shifts 24x7. If, as I predict based upon human nature, politicians kick the can on the sea level rise problem until dikes catastrophically fail in major metro areas, then yes, municipal potable water&#x27;s disaster relief equivalent may indeed cost more than an equivalent quantity of oil for at least a few years if only because it all has to be trucked in as bottles or tankers during a disaster relief operation.<p>Leaving on a couple articles about water becoming more expensive than petroleum or gasoline (note it is generally about retailed bottled water):<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018-03-worth-oil.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018-03-worth-oil.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;01&#x2F;15&#x2F;gas-cheaper-than-water-not-so-fast.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;01&#x2F;15&#x2F;gas-cheaper-than-water-not-s...</a>",,yourapostasy,,1549233929,2019-02-03T22:45:29Z,comment,19072732,19072425,,,

,,"Some previous examples of &quot;effective&quot; megapixels:<p>- The Nikon D1x had about 6 million rectangular photon wells on the sensor.

Needless to say, when actual 10 MP sensors debuted (sensors with 10 million photon wells), everyone stopped using their D1x&#x27;s.<p>- Fuji used a diagonal array of photon wells on the sensor in the Finepix S2 camera, and claimed that through interpolation, this provided 12 megapixels of effective resolution. Again, once actual 12 MP sensors debuted, the difference was obvious.<p>- Sigma used a Foveon sensor with about 3.5 million photon wells in their S9, but because each photon well independently sensed red, green, and blue wavelengths (at different depths in the well), Sigma claimed a &quot;3x factor&quot; that allowed their software to produce about 10 million effective pixels in the final image.

It&#x27;s essentially a completely different framework. You don&#x27;t expect going from Postgres 8 to Postgres 9 that the underlying query language is going to be switched out for a different one. Regularly communicating with your users, as Angular and Babel did, only reaches the engaged part of the community. A lot of workaday programmers are not that deeply engaged.

Rhino for Mac is in free beta right now - not ideal, but easy enough to learn as far as these programs go. 3D modeling really is not that easy to get a handle on, and then doing it for manufacturable parts is another thing. Uploading your files for Protomold to auto-analyze is a good way to learn about what&#x27;s manufacturable, at a really basic level (because Protomold can only make basic parts).<p>But physical prototyping depends on what you&#x27;re making, of course. The above makes sense if you&#x27;re just making a case for electronics, and it doesn&#x27;t have to have any particularly interesting performance characteristics itself. If you&#x27;re prototyping something flexible, for example, that&#x27;s really hard to prototype with a 3D printer since the likelihood of finding a printed material close to your final is small.

,,"According to the news sources I&#x27;ve been reading[0], this is a management failure by auto companies rather than some kind of structural issue with the chip industry. So it doesn&#x27;t really make sense to me that automakers might build their own fab. They&#x27;re the problem, not the fab. They&#x27;re crying to the newspapers because it looks bad to admit they were cheap and will have to furlough workers. Politicians are playing along with the shortage angle, because when you save a worker&#x27;s job they tend to vote for you. I predict the end result will be politicians spending taxpayer money to make filling these orders worth the fab&#x27;s time.<p>&gt;Mr Duesmann described the problems as “a crisis upon a crisis”. Demand for cars slumped for much of last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, prompting auto suppliers to cut their orders for the computer chips that manage everything from a car’s brakes and steering to its electric windows and distance sensors.<p>&gt;But demand for cars jumped unexpectedly in the final three months of 2020, as buyers became more optimistic. Audi had its best quarter ever, largely because of a rebound in China.<p>You say that development of the chips in cars is extremely complex, but I was under the impression car chips are generally outdated, semi-rugged processors that might have some additional safety features like lockstep cores.

,,"""...then State governments will have to pick up more of the slack.""<p>The sad thing is State governments are doing the same thing.  I reference the illusory ""let us fund education with lottery money"" mentality many states follow forcing universities and colleges to seek funding elsewhere.<p>Case in point, Truman State University, the university formerly known as Northeast Missouri State University.  Several years ago this institution embarked on a re-branding excercise to become a self-proclaimed ""little Harvard"" in order to survive.  From a financial and quality of education standpoint it has been a successful exercise. ""Truman State University's quest to become the nation's leading public liberal arts university"" is a demonstrable success regarding national ranking and all the metrics that go along with that ranking.  It is serving the nation well as an institution of higher learning.  I don't know if the same can be said for Missouri's citizens, especially those of northeast Missouri, whose children are no longer admitted.<p>I predict that education at public universities will follow the path that their affiliated extracurricular sports programs have followed as they compete for corporate largess.  Their will be a ""Top 20"" group of winners and everyone else.  Unfortunately, the Top 20 cannot educate all the students in need of an education.",,auferstehung,,1197839779,2007-12-16T21:16:19Z,comment,90167,90132,,,

College isn&#x27;t the kind of thing where you just fall into like some academic gulag. At every step of the way, people applied, got loans or secured financing, moved across the country and put in hard work to achieve. All of this to say that somehow they were tricked by the &quot;system&quot; that&#x27;s against them and is out to exploit them and their labor?<p>Now people are saying that colleges and society needs to put out a helping hand to all of these poor souls who find themselves in a position after a decade of deliberate decisions. If people put more support for this and made English PHDs more sustainable, I predict that you would see ever more PHDs and even more people trying to get into the field.<p>The problem lies in the fact that some people will make irrational decisions. Some things cost more (in money) than will give out (in money). Some people will get caught up in their love of books and academia and pursue a degree for the joy of literature but, then complain that a decade or professional reading and writing has yielded a mountain of loans and little else as prospects in the job market. It may even be that well meaning but, nefarious English professors are inspiring students to fall in love with Literature and teaching and speaking and this infatuation is causing a glut in the job market.<p>I would be more sympathetic if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that this is a decade long process and you are doing in the very environment you are trying to enter. It&#x27;d be one thing if it took a decade to become an astronaut on Mars and we had a professional industry for training astronauts that lied or hid the fact that there aren&#x27;t astronaut jobs available.<p>But, people see struggling grad students for four years in undergrad, and spend a decade being a struggling grad student. All the while pressing on. I have no sympathy for smart people making dumb decisions all the while studying books. The loud suffering of people who have made bad decisions is an important vital thing to listen to.<p>Allow people to keep making these decisions.

He looked at the problem, broke it down into its basic components, extrapolated what was going to happen, and found the most straightforward answer (UBI) from the large search space of possible solutions. You know, like a computer programmer would.<p>So I fundamentally disagree with the article for the following reasons:<p>* If I had a budget of a few million dollars and a small team of geeks like me, I could write a (non-general) AI myself in 2-10 years that would pass the Turing test in any specific area, a bit Like IBM&#x27;s Watson. And I&#x27;m nobody. The reason this won&#x27;t happen is that I don&#x27;t have the social proof (I haven&#x27;t won the internet lottery or proceeded through the graduate level accolades or submitted papers so anyone would listen to me) so I&#x27;ll likely spend the rest of my life making rent instead of making any meaningful contribution to society. And there are a million software developers around the world just like me. And a million architects who will never design a building. And a million biologists who will never cure a disease. This is the great tragedy of the commons of our time, that creates the underemployment that contributes to the wealth inequality that is the one thing holding AI back. You know, the very thing that Yang is trying to solve with UBI.<p>* I agree that shortsighted trade policies started by Reagan in the 80s with his &quot;I&#x27;m from the government and am here to help&quot; deregulation anti-pattern, exacerbated by Clinton with NAFTA, and beaten like a dead horse with George W Bush&#x27;s offshoring&#x2F;tax cut for the wealthy blue pill orgy, is the second biggest reason that we may have passed the point of no return on preserving (at least American) jobs. But half the US population won&#x27;t concede this point or think outside the box for empathetic solutions, so I don&#x27;t predict that this will be fixed before the singularity. It&#x27;s a moot point now.<p>* I predict that the tech industry will go the wrong direction with AI, in roughly this order: industry invests heavily in cybersecurity and profit-driven artificial intelligence research to better exploit users by leveraging their shopping addictions, social&#x2F;mobile bubble pops as independent developers are undermined further by receiving an ever-smaller slice of the pie, a global recession rivaling the dotcom crash and housing bubble pop hits which halts progress in social causes similarly to what happened during the lost decade of the 2000s, the US doubles down on trying every wrong thing before being forced to do the right thing (further tax cuts for the wealthy, privatization of remaining government services, no UBI because there is no money for that, further regression into service industry feudalism), sometime between 2025 and 2030 the world comes out of recession but now all money passes through an online gatekeeper (whatever follows Amazon) as the world transitions from sovereign nations to having its monetary policy determined by corporations, Stockholm syndrome far exceeding the Trump phenomenom grips the world in luddite-inspired rejection of magic technologies like AI, climate change falls from the forefront of concerns as simple human incursion into every last wild place on Earth creates an instability in civilization due to having so many insurrection cells crossing national boundaries that civic discourse gives way to political infighting and canabalistic government policy, a third world war or dystopian new world order or singularity hit all at about the same time between 2040 and 2050 so that only the rich and powerful have oracle-level AI technology and live in gated communities while the world burns, the masses find that they still need food in VR and then rise up and something happens which unfortunately can&#x27;t really be predicted past this point.<p>I really hope that I&#x27;m wrong.

What it&#x27;s really all about is the need for meaning and significance to one&#x27;s life.<p>There&#x27;s a light side too. The human need for transcendent, powerful, <i>meaningful</i> motives can inspire amazing achievements.<p>One of my favorite modern crusades-in-the-making is the colonize Mars crowd. I could see it drawing its appeal from much the same psychological basis as ISIS, but channeling that energy in a much more interesting and productive route. I can also imagine the soul searching articles of future Bourgeois critics: &quot;why would upper middle class young people with promising futures give it all up to go try to settle a desolate, airless, radiation-bathed desert and likely die in the process?&quot; Yet I predict they would, and in far greater numbers than we see joining ISIS.<p>The need for meaning and significance can drive people to do the near-impossible and inspire us all, or it can drive them to take a gun and shoot up a school or go join a death cult. I personally suspect we&#x27;ll see the latter in proportion to the absence of the former. One thing this author doesn&#x27;t really address is how the appeal of ISIS (and other smaller-scale episodes of apocalyptic-nihilistic violence) is rooted in the banality of our culture, and what we might do about that. We spend an amazing amount of time and energy on worthless bullshit, and an equally amazing amount of energy convincing ourselves it&#x27;s important.",,api,,1435773255,2015-07-01T17:54:15Z,comment,9813805,9813542,,,

Nintendo isn&#x27;t in the same market as the other two.</i><p>Nintendo might be a running joke amongst hardcore gamers but ironically they&#x27;re the most successful console manufacturer out there.<p>The Switch is going from strength to strength and I&#x27;d estimate it will outsell the Playstation 4 before Nintendo retire it (it&#x27;s been outselling the PS4 since 2019 already but that&#x27;s to be expected given the expectation of the PS5). And from the same trial that bought us this submission we&#x27;ve seen Microsoft admit that they&#x27;ve never made a profit on the Xbox. Let&#x27;s also not forget that games on the Switch are typically more expensive than the same game on other platforms. And that&#x27;s without even touching the topic of Nintendo&#x27;s 1st party games -- they make an absolute killing on their IP. Animal Crossing, for example, was seen by many as the unofficial game of the 2020 lockdown.<p>I predict Nintendo&#x27;s market position will only get stronger too. With many Xbox fans giving up on buying new consoles because they&#x27;re basically just PCs at this point. So switching to PCs that can be upgraded over time and still have access to Xbox content. Plus the struggles Sony have had just shipping their latest consoles and many gamers there saying they might just stick with the PS4. Yet Nintendo have calved out their own corner of the market that sits between the ultra competitive hardcore market and casual gamers who want more than crappy mobile apps. And it&#x27;s a segment that&#x27;s increasing in size too.<p>It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how Valves offering does. I can&#x27;t see it competing with the Switch directly but it might take more market share away from Sony and Microsoft given Valves new portable offers the capability of desktop gaming on the move.<p>So anyway, back to your point. You might scoff but actually Nintendo are in a far more stable and successful position than Sony and Microsoft (with regards to consoles).",,hnlmorg,,1629633012,2021-08-22T11:50:12Z,comment,28264702,28263882,,,

,,"Free Speech isn&#x27;t the direct issue here.<p>YouTube and other social media platforms are engaged in an exploitive bait and switch, which happens to collide with the speech issues. However, the core issue is one where speech is just the game ball.<p>Social Media platforms tell creators and their fans that they will act as &quot;platforms&quot; for the creator&#x27;s free expression -- provided it&#x27;s in line with the &quot;Terms of Service.&quot; However, it the &quot;Terms of Service&quot; is a bugaboo. Social Media platforms are effectively manipulating the speech of their creators to tell their own ideological message, using censorship, the threat of demonetization, the threat of de-platforming, and the manipulative denial of viral spread -- in uncountable cases, with no reasonable connection to their terms of service. It would be one thing, if this were always actually to &quot;preserve the value of their platform for advertisers&quot; or some such, but the record bears out in innumerable instances that many of their actions are the grinding of an ideological axe by lower level company functionaries.<p>This is a bait and switch. With one hand, the platforms are saying, &quot;We will serve as your conduit,&quot; then with the other hand, they are saying, &quot;You will send the ideological message that we want you to say, or else!&quot; Many will say that this is their right as a private company. No private company has the right to say they will do one thing, but then dishonestly do the opposite through murky deception and threats.<p>The record of illogical, nonsensical, and weird contortions &quot;platforms&quot; go through to hide ideological manipulation is legion.

I've gotten 20% lifts out of ""stupid little things"" like that before, and seen good writeups of the same from other people.  But e.g. designers do not want to hear that the thing they spend 98% of their time on is essentially meaningless and the elements of the page which they scrutinize least carefully -- like microcopy or button text or (in one memorable test) which way the stock photo model is facing dominate the measurable results.  This is like how doctors do not want to hear that the difference in clinical outcomes due to professional experience is totally dwarfed by the difference in clinical outcomes due to following checklists.  (On the plus side, designers don't kill anybody for their professional pride.)<p>In general, I think the point of A/B testing is that you should ruthlessly soulcrush what you want with what the data actually tells you.

,,"The powers that be aren&#x27;t trying to crash it all on purpose, nobody wants another 2008. They have produced a pretty hands-off response, because of a number of factors. Crypto has an explicit project to escape US regulation, so lots of money is in e.g. the Bahamas and difficult to target. Many companies are trying really hard to avoid even having US customers, so that&#x27;s a hands-off win for regulation as the feds have nobody to protect from e.g. Binance directly. The big companies that do operate in the US have led a mostly successful campaign to position themselves as innovators and deserving of a long leash, IMO too successfully as only now is the SEC feeling the pressure to clamp down. There is a long tail of complex regulatory actions to take against really quite small individual operations. Finally I think a lot of this has been influenced to a huge degree by the cheapness of cash, and increasing interest rates will do a lot of the work people want to see from regulation by forcing people to make better investments and making bonds&#x2F;deposits more appealing as people look for an alternative to the apparent huge risk that they&#x27;re discovering they&#x27;ve been given a premium for taking on until now.<p>The answer on regulation is a mix, then. Some of it has been effective (if only at scaring off potential investor dangers completely), some of it is difficult, some of the response is underwhelming. So far there hasn&#x27;t been a 2008-scale meltdown because it hasn&#x27;t been a big enough market to have a domino effect, and I still don&#x27;t think it is yet, so really now&#x27;s the time to take preventive measures but it&#x27;s not too late for that. It is too late to protect all the people who&#x27;ve lost big so far, but that is a much smaller number than those who suffered in 2008. In my opinion the movers and shakers who care about worldwide financial stability are tuning in around the right time and are overwhelmingly accepting that regulation is going to be necessary.

(`implements` maybe less so, but there Typescript uses `implements` in very specific contexts and Typescript has the benefit of type information to narrow between existing uses of `implements` and some theoretical crazy new language feature yet to be proposed.)<p>It&#x27;s interesting to note too that `interface` and `implements` have been reserved keywords since ES 2. It should be unsurprising that the &quot;lost&quot; ES 4 usage of `interface` and `implements` looks very, very similar to how Typescript uses those keywords (as can be seen in &#x27;real life&#x27; in ActionScript 3).<p>«The advantage of using the TypeScript compiler is that even if that happens, you can just compile away the differences. The disadvantage is that you’re not really writing standard JavaScript anymore. I predict that TypeScript won’t be able to maintain its position as a superset of JavaScript. I believe it will inevitably diverge over the years.»<p>Thus far the Typescript team has done an admirable job at pivoting to meet the ES spec, even as the spec has changed. (Examples can be seen in things like the module import syntax and &quot;inner modules&quot; now &quot;namespaces&quot;.) Thus far TS has been good to add deprecation warnings of the non-standard ways of doing things and TS benefits from being a compiler here in that you can ratchet up the strictness checks including making sure you aren&#x27;t using non-standard features. Presumably such checks will also keep up and pivot with spec changes.<p>Beyond that, I think it is easy to argue that Typescript is approaching the critical mass in developer usage and mindset that Typescript will as much be helping to guide future specs as it will have to try to keep up with them.<p>Especially in the current &quot;Stage Progression&quot; system that ECMA&#x27;s TC39 has moved to, Typescript (and fellow tools like Babel) is a bellwether &quot;early stage&quot; laboratory to test and verify early proposals long before they become specifications.",,WorldMaker,,1465407921,2016-06-08T17:45:21Z,comment,11864050,11862653,,,

,,"Might just be a bit too exaggerated, especially about the comparison with taxi. I don&#x27;t think Uber is great but let&#x27;s be honest, the taxi system is not great in a lot of places either and taxi drivers in a lot of cases are treated even much worse. In China the simple fact is Uber-like companies have allowed people to earn so much more than under monopolized taxi companies, such that huge swarms of taxi drivers just simply quit their jobs already. Most drivers I talked to are very happy with their income and flexible working hours (with many part-timing), so I&#x27;m not sure where the &quot;15-hour-per-day&quot; work applies to. Certainly not what I could see.<p>Of course, this could also be a result of the short-term boom of this industry, where big players are just investing tons of money. The long-term impact remains to be seen. I predict a lot of drivers will be out of job by then since there&#x27;re way too many of them currently. But to say &quot;we must preserve this job done by human beings because we don&#x27;t have universal income yet&quot; is sheer nonsense. I can&#x27;t believe somebody so proficient with technology could say that. I&#x27;m all in for universal income, but for each technological advancement there&#x27;re bound to be old jobs washed out. Artificially holding them does absolutely no good to progress and people&#x27;s well-being.

,,"EPIC also had numerous problems. The most severe I think was that it exposed the innermost workings of the chip.<p>That sounds like an awesome idea, but it&#x27;s actually a major issue because once you expose something you freeze it in time forever.<p>Pretty much all modern processors larger than in-order embedded cores are basically virtual machines implemented in hardware. The actual execution units are behind a sophisticated instruction decoder that schedules operations to achieve maximum instruction level parallelism and balance many other concerns including heat and power use in modern designs.<p>The presence of this translation layer frees the innermost core of the chip to evolve with almost total freedom. Even if fundamental innovations were discovered like practical trinary logic or quantum acceleration of some kind, this could safely be kept behind the instruction decoder.<p>EPIC on the other hand by exposing the core freezes it. I predict that if EPIC would have taken over eventually you&#x27;d have... drum roll... <i>an instruction decoder</i> for each EPIC &quot;lane&quot; or whatever that did exactly what today&#x27;s instruction decoders do. It probably would have ended up evolving into a synchronous multithreaded vector processor with cores that look not unlike today&#x27;s cores complete with pipelines and instruction schedulers and all the rest of that stuff.<p>I can imagine one scenario where EPIC and other designs that show their guts could work, but it would require the cooperation of operating system vendors. (Stop laughing!)<p>OSes could implement the instruction decoder layer in software, transpiling binaries from a standard bitcode like WASM, JVM bytecode, LLVM intermediate code, and&#x2F;or even pre-existing instruction sets like X86 and ARM to the underlying instruction set of the processor core. Each new processor core would require what amounts to a driver that would look not unlike an LLVM code generator.<p>Have fun getting OS vendors to do that. Another major problem would be that CPU vendors would be incentivized to distribute these things as opaque blobs, making it very hard for open source OSes to support new chip versions. It would be a bit like the ARM &#x2F; mobile phone binary blob hell, which is one of the factors making it hard to ship open source phone OSes or make open phones.<p>Keeping the instruction decoder on the silicon basically just avoids this whole shitshow. It lets the CPU vendors keep their innovations closed as they wish without imposing that closed-ness on the OS or apps.<p>The final issue with kernel compilation is that the performance probably wouldn&#x27;t be much better than what we get now. We&#x27;d trade the overhead of an instruction decoder in silicon for a lot of JIT or AOT compilation and caching in the OS kernel. The performance and power use hit might be just as large or larger.",,api,,1577464251,2019-12-27T16:30:51Z,comment,21892221,21888979,,,

Because when you see the nuclear bombs flying, there is <i>nothing</i> you can do anymore to win the war. The only thing that you can do is to prevent the loss of more lives by standing down and calling off the counter attack. The only logical move is to renege on your &quot;credible&quot; second strike promise, stand down, and start printing the enemy&#x27;s flags. In practice, modern warfare is not about conquering the enemy country, it is about destroying the enemy military and state, which would be achived by airstrikes and&#x2F;or a nuclear strike. For these reasons, I predict the boundary between conventional war and nuclear war to become more blurry (US and Russia have been trying this for decades with the development of smaller nukes, and missile defense systems), and conventional war to return to Europe.<p>The way to stop this is not in strengthening the NATO and going black to block confrontation.

,,"I used primary data from the World Health Organization to predict the trajectory of the 2019 Coronavirus outbreak on a country-by-country basis.

The 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak is at an inflection point.<p>2. The data strongly suggests that the number of coronavirus cases grows exponentially in countries that do not mandate quarantines, restrictions on travel and public gatherings, and closing of schools, universities and workplaces (“Social Distancing”).<p>3. The number of coronavirus cases compounds at more than 25% per day in countries that do not mandate social distancing. This behavior is consistent across Iran, Italy, Spain, France, and the UK, each measured independently from the date of the first case in that country, with root-mean-square accuracy R^2 &gt; 99%.<p>4. The highly precise exponential growth strongly suggests that the growth in these cases is due to an underlying biological phenomenon (e.g. virus transmission) rather than due to an increase in the availability of tests or the number of tests performed.<p>5. At a density of approximately 9.7 coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants, Italy mandated on 3&#x2F;8&#x2F;20 a complete regional lock-down, with movement restrictions applying to about 16 million people (25% of the population of Italy).

I computed 87 cases per 100,000 inhabitants as the threshold density at which all currently unoccupied intensive care unit (ICU) beds would be occupied by a US person who is infected with coronavirus and has severe, life-threatening symptoms. In other words, no regional beds to house patients who are severely ill.<p>All of these numbers are an underestimate of the actual numbers with the US numbers being one of the most underestimated. However, this underestimate won’t affect the March 30 or April 9 prediction much (moving them sooner by a few days) since the underestimate is a multiplicative factor whereas the growth is exponential.",,micahsiegel,,1583985504,2020-03-12T03:58:24Z,comment,22553610,22553402,,,

Dave Rosenthal was a big proponent of X11 and after a few years it looked like it <i>might</i> be useful and Sun put a lot of effort around aligning the kernel the user land tools, the libraries, etc. We all worked for the same company and it was still a horribly arduous task.

A lot of strong, correct, and incompatible opinions makes for slow going. Part of the challenge is everyone brings their own requirements which makes their opinion more applicable.

Rust: slow to compile. That contributes to programmer productivity.<p>5. Go: both language and fundamental libraries (networking, concurrency, json, xml, databases etc.) are mature and stable.<p>Rust: language is still evolving. Ecosystem of fundamental libraries is sometimes lacking important stuff, has too many options (which of 3 json libraries should I use) or options are still not mature.<p>6. Go: large and growing list of tools, both shipped as part of Go and made by community (debuggers, memory and cpu profilers, race detector, runtime tracing for debugging multi-threading).<p>Rust: not so much.<p>7. Go: a large number of important code-bases are written in Go, proving that it&#x27;s suitable for large scale software (docker, kubernetes, prometheus, influxdb, tidb, cockroachdb - those are from memory.<p>Rust: mozilla is dabbling with using Rust for FireFox but I don&#x27;t know any large project that went full Rust.<p>8.

,,"I mean, I think they&#x27;re covering it with the opinion of &quot;why the fuck would you fight a 20 year war and just drop the ball completely now,&quot; which is fair, considering that when we invaded they were uniformly like &quot;why the fuck is America invading.&quot; I want to strongly separate Iraq from Afghanistan in this, because there was absolutely no reason for us to invade Iraq or to promote the Arab Spring or any of the other absurd things we did post-9&#x2F;11. These were actually all distractions from and drains upon the mission in Afghanistan. We have an obligation to prevent the Taliban from taking hold there again. And any renewal of their power directly impacts our security. We had no moral right to withdraw, and Biden did it as fast as he could just because it was popular. I understand why it was popular, but that doesn&#x27;t make it right for us or the people who are trapped there. It makes us look weak and it destroys the hope that people around the world place in us. For better or worse, we <i>are</i> the only power capable of holding back the forces of chaos around the world, and <i>that</i> is where we put our footprint because <i>these specific people, the Taliban</i> aided and abetted an attack on our civilian population. We should never make peace with them, because they have no concept of peace. They will attack us at the first opportunity.<p>I predict within a couple months they will execute American hostages and we will have to return to Afghanistan. It may be something like Carter&#x27;s self-immolation in Iran. If so it will only lead to a more isolationist right-wing regime under Trump or someone else in the US. Isolationism <i>does not work</i>. America is a global power and needs to act as one. Globalism is the future and it shouldn&#x27;t be controlled by China and Russia while we retreat from it. I&#x27;m no neocon or fan of Bush-style pre-emptive strikes.

,,"&gt; One of the hardest parts of parenting (and of growing up!) is getting kids to do things that they don’t enjoy.<p>This sounds like &quot;eat your wheaties&quot;, and I think this is a faulty premise &#x2F; self fulfilling prophesy &#x2F; you&#x27;re asking the wrong question. To echo some of the other comments on this thread, chores should not be viewed as &quot;eat your wheaties&quot;, but rather are an opportunity for meaningful connection and a way for child to bond with family and community.<p>I&#x27;d go even further and say children given the right environment and at the right age <i>want</i> to do chores. Chores can and should be enjoyable and meaningful. For evidence, take a look into the Montessori method and in particular Montessori Practical life. I think you&#x27;ll find the following:<p>- A wealth of anecdotal examples of children doing chores on their own for fulfillment and to demonstrate their independence. (No daddy, let me do it <i>myself</i>!)<p>- Children want to do chores because that&#x27;s what they see their parents doing, and also because they have a drive towards their own independence. (corollary: the same goes for smartphones and other addictions)<p>- Where this goes wrong is when parents either help too much (not giving the child opportunities), or when parents overcriticize (not giving the child space to learn). The root problem is not one of incentives, but of either miscommunication, lack of communication, or too-high or too-low expectations.<p>A caveat here: Montessori Practical Life is oriented towards 3-6 year olds. Based on your origin story if you&#x27;re thinking about the age where you were playing video games, you were probably older than 6, and maybe that&#x27;s the age group you&#x27;re targetting.<p>Given what I see as the root causes of chore distaste though, I don&#x27;t feel that incentivizing things via a video game will solve the problem even for older children--I predict dependency on Joon and habits going away as soon as that crutch is removed.<p>But maybe I and others are being too negative. Maybe there&#x27;s a path to bootstrapping from Joon to more meaningful connection and weaning off of the game? Given that you have the will and energy to throw at the problem, maybe you can discover a solution to this weaning problem. Maybe you can discover a path to bootstrap from Joon to meaningful child-family and child-community connection.<p>Since you have energy and interest, here&#x27;s some exposure to my viewpoint sources, in the interests of converting you to what I see as a healthier worldview, so that as you spread your worldview it&#x27;s tempered with mine. I&#x27;d recommend you look at a few of the following resources:<p>- Talk to your local Montessori community. Find an AMI-certified school and talk to the staff about Montessori Practical Life, and how it compares to or might relate to Joon.<p>- Ask them to refer you to the article &quot;Stop Saying Good Job To Your Kids (and what to say instead)&quot;. I&#x27;m finding a few articles with that title but can&#x27;t find the particular one that I&#x27;m thinking of. Your Montessori guides will know.<p>- Read &quot;Taking Charge&quot;: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smile.amazon.com&#x2F;Taking-Charge-Caring-Discipline-School-ebook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B006VJIYOS"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smile.amazon.com&#x2F;Taking-Charge-Caring-Discipline-Sch...</a> . Not Montessori, but a similar vein, and I feel like it tries to tackle the same problem you&#x27;re tackling--building up &quot;good&quot; behaviors. Goes at it more from a Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs perspective, but I think all these life philosophies are in the same family, and a healthier counterpoint than the &quot;Eat your wheaties&quot; philosophy I see reflected in your post.<p>---<p>Tangentially, I find the &quot;eat your wheaties&quot; mentality distasteful even for adults, but maybe this is just a quirk of my own psychology. Any time I perceive something as &quot;I should do this because it&#x27;s good for me&quot; rather than &quot;I do this because I enjoy it&quot;, I just fall into a procrastination loop. I literally lack the ability to take the &quot;force myself through&quot; path, and in the long term this has been a blessing. To &quot;correct&quot; my habits (I did, like you, grow up also playing many thousands of hours of video games, and I didn&#x27;t exercise enough and tended to stay up late to boot), I&#x27;ve always had to find intrinsic enjoyment in my new habits, whether that be cleaning, eating more vegetables, getting more exercise, etc. In the end I&#x27;ve made the happy discovery that my tastes are very malleable, and this is the best tool in my belt for self-shaping.<p>An informal support for my way of doing things being more widely applicable: there seems to be a lot of research floating around supporting that procrastination is due to negative emotional associations.<p>In that light, it seems what Joon does is try to paper over that negative emotional association by providing a counterbalancing positive emotional association. I&#x27;d imagine where you&#x27;ll see success here is incidentally--Joon might overcome initial resistance and sometimes if a person does the chore enough the original negative association might fade towards neutral, at which point the bootstrapping problem is half-solved. I&#x27;d imagine this doesn&#x27;t happen in all or even a majority of cases though.<p>---<p>To draw another analogy-- because of how you frame chores, I have a hard time imagining Joon being able to frame chores as anything greater than grinding mobs for XP. Grinding mobs is a boring chore, but XP is rewarding, so that makes grinding mobs fun, right?? <i>Hecka</i> no! XP is just a number on a screen, and grinding mobs is boring as all heck.<p>No, I play RPGs for <i>challeging dungeons</i> and <i>boss fights</i> and <i>hard mode</i>. Bosses do drop more XP, but XP and loot are not what make boss fights fun. Boss fights are enjoyable for the <i>intrinsic challenge</i> and the <i>satisfaction of growing to meet that challenge</i>. In Joon, what would constitute a boss fight? And how would you motivate it?<p>More generally, where in Joon is the feeling of personal skill progression? In the best games (and in life), this goes deeper than just my on-screen character gaining skills-- <i>I personally</i> get better at the game, and can feel it. What is the analogous feeling in Joon? Given your focus, I&#x27;d imagine this would have to be some form of getting better and faster at the chores themselves and eager to further test my skills in real life.",,NAR8789,,1642618775,2022-01-19T18:59:35Z,comment,29998321,29994310,,,

,,"I&#x27;d like to add an observation regarding the application layer, as well as a prediction:<p>The last ten years have largely seen the internet (and technology in general) making things more convenient for the majority of the population: Think phones &#x2F; &quot;the internet at your fingertips&quot;, cloud apps that synchronize our data across devices, content platforms like Netflix &amp; Spotify &amp; &lt;insert your favorite newspaper&gt; which allow us to consume our favorite content anywhere, anytime, and online stores like Amazon that allow us to get our hands on practically any product we could wish for—now even within the same day. There are also fitness trackers which record all the data for us that, previously, we would have had to measure and jot down manually (which is why we didn&#x27;t), and messengers like WhatsApp which allow us to get in touch with anyone at any time. (Anyone remember how the contacts we had in AIM&#x2F;YIM&#x2F;ICQ&#x2F;MSN messenger used to be online only when they were at their computer? How annoying it used to be to exchange files and photos with friends?) We even have personal assistants now which remind us of upcoming events, notify us about traffic jams on our way to work and allow us to communicate with our devices through speech and thus in a more natural way. Finally, don&#x27;t forget news feeds and content aggregators like Facebook, Instagram and Google News which make it so effortless to consume content that, for many users, they have basically become the only portal to the internet and any content outside these platforms is basically invisible unless some post on, say, Facebook links to it. Which, in turn, implies that providers outside these platforms necessarily have to somehow pick up their users on these platforms and bring them to theirs. (Remember how it used to be the other way around? But how many people really still type in URLs in their browser&#x27;s address bar these days? How annoying and inconvenient!)<p>At the same time, almost all platforms that have risen over the past ten years are those whose value proposition is precisely this: Convenience. One could even say that the reason today&#x27;s internet is an internet of monopolies and big walled gardens is that it&#x27;s more convenient. Even the internet of things basically is&#x2F;will be nothing else than added convenience (at least when it comes to private consumers).<p>On the other hand, the reason that privacy and security concerns don&#x27;t matter to the vast majority of internet users is that they are not only not convenient—they are the exact opposite. The same thing goes for the algorithms that tell us what to consume. Even if they all were open-source, who would really take the time to understand how they work?<p>Call me a pessimist but I predict that this trend will prevail. Every consumer-oriented Next Big Thing® will make our lives even easier. At the same time, we will continue to lose control over our data and over what we consume as algorithms dictate our interests.<p>Remember how the internet of the 2000s used to be this promised land where, to us techies, anything seemed to be possible? This internet which was going to be oh-so egalitarian and which promised to bring democracy to the entire world? These times are over.

,,"&#62; That article doesn't seem to give much sway to the issue of transaction costs in letting people organise to provide a public good, which is really central to the issue..<p>There are transaction costs for Government action too. In general they are higher. Government has no special ability to keep transaction costs low.<p>&#62; Surely as argued above, contagious disease prevention would qualify as a public good<p>It has excludable (""public"") and non-excludable aspects like all goods. It's certainly possible, in theory, to make a profit off it. But today no such thing is organized, meanwhile the Government does have it under control, and the total cost isn't very high relative to the country's wealth. So there's much, much higher priorities to privatize like the postal system or social security.<p>I think reform needs to go one step at a time. Do I predict that contagious disease control will and should one day be done differently? Yes I guess so, though the far future is quite hazy. Let's not worry too much about that because by the time we get closer to doing something it will be a lot clearer what works or not.<p>But when you bring up something like education, where we already have many private educational institutions, and public schools are widely regarded as largely failing, no I don't think the Government is good at this and no I don't want to spend billions in taxes on throwing money at stuff with <i>institutional</i> problems other than underfunding (e.g. teacher's unions and <i>the wrong epistemology</i>).<p>A good transitional proposal is vouchers. In this way the Government can subsidize poor people or any other favored group while not actually running any schools.

In fact, your description also describes a huge variety of economic activities from long-term fundamentals investing to using crude oil futures contracts to hedge an airline's jet fuel price exposure.  (Note that since airlines don't refine their own jet fuel, they don't intend to take delivery of the crude, and their hedging activity depends on later selling to crude oil consumers.)<p>If it takes 30 pages of stochastic calculus to explain the utility provided by a fund, the public is going to dismiss the fund as ""providing no value"" and the fund isn't going to bother even trying to defend itself, because it just sounds like excuses, even if there is very real value being provided.<p>Many times the fallacy is in assuming that all market participants care only about average returns, when risk/volatility play a big role in the utility functions of the vast majority of market participants.<p>For a very simplified example, let's say QFundA has discovered some very reliable heuristic for the movements of a variety of small cap retail equities over the one-week timeframe.  Let's also say that Pensions R Us has decided to sell 50% of the average daily volume of a regional sporting goods retailer over the next 2 days.  If QFundA's model strongly suggests that the price is going up over the week, QFundA may slowly take on those shares over 2 days (and hedge against big news using out of the money puts), followed by slowly selling them off over the following 2 trading days to market participants who weren't interested a few days earlier.  QFundA has made money by smoothing out prices (and likely reducing the bid-ask spread).  Pensions R Us gets a better average price than they would have otherwise, as QFundA's buying activity has offset the market impact of Pensions R Us's selling activity.<p>Impatient/risk adverse market participants may have lower average returns because of QFundA's activities, but perhaps they're more than happy to pay a few basis points in order to get into or out of their positions faster.  It's entirely possible that QFundA only slightly reduces average returns of other market participants while greatly reducing volatility, and thus bringing up everyone else's Sharpe ratios.  In other words, when you take into account the fact that volatility/risk pays a big role in the utility functions of most market participants, it's possible that everyone wins, despite QFundA providing ""zero value added"" from the narrow viewpoint that only looks at the long-term price prediction provided by long-term ""fundamentals"" investors.<p>QFundA's strategy could still be summarized as ""I know [predict high probability that] somebody else will buy X, so let's buy X first and sell it to them at a higher price"", and yet QFundA provides real value to the market as a whole.<p>There are some predatory strategies that don't provide any value to other market participants.  However, just because you don't understand the value provided by some market participant (and they know that trying to explain it is just going to sound like nonsense excuses to someone with your level of understanding) doesn't mean that no value is added.",,KMag,,1354140304,2012-11-28T22:05:04Z,comment,4845042,4841380,,,

In the future, there'll be less $30 oil but we'll still have lots of $80 oil.   But that $80 oil will have the benefit of 50 years of technological advances to drive its price down.<p>2.

Evaluating&#x2F;validating a model, analyzing and preparing your data, anticipating model performance, understanding what to do to improve your fit, model selection or architecture.

,,"I predict tough times for these guys. I remember when Zivity launched as the last ""Venture Capital funded porn startup"". Shortly afterwards the team dissolved, they gave back back most of the funding because they agreed with the investors that it was never going to be big and the shoestring team that remained reinvented the site as (as far as I can see) a niche, subscription site.<p>I also think there are some warning bells in the Techcrunch article:<p>&#62;""Internet porn sites are still shameful artifacts of a decade past — from when the Internet was a collection of websites featuring low-resolution images and oversized banner ads""<p>You should always be very careful when labelling a sophisticated and fast-moving industry as out-dated as the accusation can come straight back at you. The current sites could be better designed but frankly they are not bad and represent huge technical feats, streaming massive amounts of video to huge numbers of people. Since what they give out is free and they've been going for as long as YouTube I think it's fair to conclude that they're  monetising that content effectively via advertising.<p>I'd be very surprised if this is an industry which can be won by design improvements. I think there are largely two types of company 1) the free sites who generate most of their cash from lead gen and advertising 2) the subscription sites who create content that's sufficiently high quality or niche that people will pay for it. The latter sites are the revenue stream for the former.<p>Paintbottle looks to me like it's going to catch itself in between these two models. I would guess it's going to struggle as a free site (since it doesn't have any ads) and will also struggle as a paid site because it's not sufficiently niche and its funding expectations may preclude the types of revenues it could viably make. The sooner it figures out which one it actually is the more likely it is to succeed.",,petenixey,,1366280316,2013-04-18T10:18:36Z,comment,5569740,5569546,,,

,,"I am 20 years out of college with a CS degree, working in your typical business rules development kind of job.  Exactly the kind of job that doesn&#x27;t need a CS degree, but I&#x27;m perfectly decent at programming business rules, so there&#x27;s that.<p>Last year, I&#x27;ve been on a learning binge myself, due to the fact that I want to understand the underlying workings of the technologies that are shaping our near future.  In this interest, I have taken what little time I have (with a job and two children) to relearn the baseline college mathematics that I&#x27;ve lost from my apathy towards serious continuing education.  I first completed the course &quot;Learning How to Learn&quot; and applied the practices within to courses in Calculus and Physics.  I&#x27;m close to completing Single Variable Calculus on the OCW website on MIT.<p>I was never a great student, and it could be just because, as I think I&#x27;ve discovered, I&#x27;m just a slow learner.  My early educational talents and successes were due to a lot of early reading that I did, but it&#x27;s clear to me that it takes a lot of repetition before I start to understand a subject, and I often have to go back over lectures, then read the associated notes, and run through a ton of practice problems (which I then put into anki) before I grasp a subject.  Due to this my learning has been slow (along with the two kid situation), but I&#x27;m certain now that I have a much better grasp of the subject matter than I did when I was twenty.  I&#x27;m not suggesting I&#x27;m smarter with age, what I am suggesting is that I didn&#x27;t have study habits that allowed me to flourish.<p>Clearly, the current educational models that we are using in our schools are failing students like me who get a good head start due to early reading, but can&#x27;t learn fast enough to keep up in a classroom environment.  It is clear from what I&#x27;ve learned about the learning process from Barbara Oakley and others that the actual processes that we put in place are further suboptimal for the learning process, but the ways that we set up our education system are not the result of experimentation.  If I were to surmise their source, I would say that they are explicitly designed to fail, so that we can excuse reduced spending in public education systems.<p>Still, these self-study courses are great for people like me, as long as you are permitted to study at your own rate.  This is important as I&#x27;m going to guess that perserverance is as important as intelligence when it comes to advancing to the point where you can aid research teams.  I predict that nations that automate educational models (as well as hiring a broad staff of educators, lecturers, and tutors) that are successful will have a much larger impact on the future of the information age than they did in previous eras.",,moosey,,1575660242,2019-12-06T19:24:02Z,comment,21725108,21724247,,,

The videos on the site make it seem like a completely passive experience.<p>- Craft activities seem like a distraction from reading unless the activities are grounded in literacy (e.g. letter&#x2F;word games or creations).

Where Ono Sendai created the decks used to jack into the net and transport someones conscious online.<p>While the idea of navigating the internet in a way analogous to physically walking is clumsy - what we have with glass is the reverse. Where you have the immediacy of the internet available to your physical reality.<p>Banning the first iteration, even before its available, is already a lost cause. By the time we hit 2020 - Google will have done more to bring us to the Neuromancing reality than most, and we will have iteration N of Glass at that time - likely available to either ocular implants of lens overlays.<p>Having had my first child in 2004, where I saw that she would be 16 in 2020, the same age as I was when I was roleplaying the Cyberpunk character in 2020, I go back and forth on whether I think that the tech level available to her when she is 16 is going to be a good thing or a bad thing.<p>There are a lot of things that I have let go as they came about and chose not to be an early adopter of, but Glass is one that I can't wait to get my hands on. While I have no idea if I would want to imbue my entire life with Glass - as that sounds like a Bad Thing (TM) - One cannot deny how potentially revolutionary this will be to the world once truly widely available.<p>Whats more interesting to me, than the <i></i><i>banning</i><i></i> of Glass, is what the unseen reactionary responses, derivative and evolutionary apps and uses will be.<p>Iteration one has the small prism screen to the right. I predict this will be one of the first things to be extended by adopters who wish for full visual overlay.<p>Augmented full field vision is low hanging fruit. Glass will enable a true BIM overlay industry. (People like PlanGrid should be pissing their pants to get access to Glass, and if they are not - then they are far too short-sighted)<p>One thing I am keenly interested in trying is FPV training for things like martial arts.<p>Activities such as skiing, snowboarding, skydiving, etc are cool to watch from an FPV standpoint - but viewing an FPV of a long ride, great jump, etc will not necessarily be something a viewer can gain much more instructive value from, I believe.<p>However, as a martial arts instructor myself, I would like to see how an FPV view of some of the throws and holds I teach would be received.<p>TL;DR: Banning is a lost battle. in 2020 Glass will be a primary data interface to millions.",,samstave,,1362953068,2013-03-10T22:04:28Z,comment,5353692,5353443,,,

,,"I predict that streaming, listener analytics and metrics will have a much bigger effect on music production by removing the human producers for mass consumption pop music in the next two decades. The writing is on the wall.<p>We&#x27;re already at a point where the producers (who compose the songs and usually even create the audio using computer software) spend a lot of time analyzing the metrics they get from Spotify et al. They look for stats on how many seconds someone listens to a track before skipping to the next one, do they turn the volume up or down, which songs are paired to the same playlists, etc etc.<p>When reading interviews of musicians, they frequently bring this up and usually not in a positive light. You can also hear the results if you&#x27;re exposed to modern pop music - when there&#x27;s a hit single, there will be quite a few copycats that will shamelessly borrow the elements of the hit. This is not a new thing but the degree to which it&#x27;s occuring is.<p>Now what&#x27;s good at looking at metrics, doing tiny adjustments and gradient descending towards some local optimum and cheaper than hiring a musician? A machine learning algorithm of course.<p>While it&#x27;s not common yet, there have been some fairly impressive demonstrations I&#x27;ve heard. Computer-generated music notation is easy to generate (read: number of bits in the output is rather low) and has been experimented with for a long time.<p>But this can go even a step further, rather than producing sheet music, an algorithm can generate the <i>audio</i> directly. As in the PCM audio waveforms (or maybe spectrograms, frequency domain might be easier for algorithms). I recall hearing AI-generated classical music audio (found through HN) which sounded fairly convincing to me (albeit with a white-ish noise on the background).<p>If you&#x27;re a professional pop music producer, make the most out of your career while you can. You&#x27;re closer to being replaced by robots than you think.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that human musicians will go away any time soon, I&#x27;m sure people will enjoy playing instruments with their own hands in the future.

,,"&gt;The average American believes that the richest fifth own 59% of the wealth and that the bottom 40% own 9%. The reality is strikingly different. The top 20% of US households own more than 84% of the wealth, and the bottom 40% combine for a paltry 0.3%. The Walton family, for example, has more wealth than 42% of American families combined.<p>&gt;We don’t want to live like this. In our ideal distribution, the top quintile owns 32% and the bottom two quintiles own 25%. As the journalist Chrystia Freeland put it,  “Americans actually live in Russia, although they think they live in Sweden. And they would like to live on a kibbutz.” Norton and Ariely found a surprising level of consensus: everyone — even Republicans and the wealthy—wants a more equal distribution of wealth than the status quo.<p>You&#x27;d think they&#x27;d sanity check their poetic description against professed beliefs. If your metric says that most Americans &quot;would like to live on a kibbutz&quot;, then your metric is <i>wrong</i>.<p>What this actually shows is that most Americans <i>have no idea what wealth inequality looks like.</i> Ask the same group of people their predicted and ideal <i>income</i> inequality measurements.

And how much inequality do they desire? These questions have a range of important policy implications. However, the initial answers to these questions need to be reconsidered. Our findings indicate that the remarkably low estimates of wealth inequality given by Norton and Ariely’s respondents depended on the particular measure (quintile percentages) that was used. When asked to state quintile percentages for either household wealth, teacher salaries, or web page clicks, our respondents seemed to use an anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic leading to very similar responses across very different domains.<p>&gt;When respondents were relieved of aggregating their intuitions about inequality into quintile percentages, another picture emerged. According to this new picture, Americans do not tend to have extremely biased perceptions of current levels of inequality. Nor do they entertain an ideal of near-perfect egalitarianism. Rather they seem to prefer a world where the poor are not as poor as they are today. Further investigation into this more tractable ideal might provide a basis for workable policy prescriptions.",,JCzynski,,1496934498,2017-06-08T15:08:18Z,comment,14514688,14504811,,,

,,"Speculating for fun:<p>If you read into Signal&#x27;s group chat, it ends up being indistinguishable from standard chat in the sense that the server is unaware of any &quot;group&quot; abstraction. The clients figure out how to thread messages based on encrypted message headers. From the outside, it just looks like N simultaneous outgoing messages from one user.<p>This is nice, as the server doesn&#x27;t have to remember who you were in a group with, and it&#x27;s only a bit worse than the obvious (single message to server + broadcast to group members) approach because only the sender has to pay the cost of sending the N messages. All receivers still just receive 1.<p>Extending to video chat, this would be quite difficult. To keep the necessary streams open and preserve the group-ignorant server design, each client has to open N connections to all other participants. That&#x27;s a rough way for video streams to scale especially when routed through the same central infrastructure.<p>Group calls would probably need server side group-aware logic to mux the feeds together, which would sacrifice some of the server&#x27;s data minimalism.

Not sticking with Promises: This is changing, slowly. You can `import {readFile} from &#x27;fs&#x2F;promises&#x27;` in Node and it works as you&#x27;d expect, including top-level await. (Backwards compatibility means the callback API can never go away.)<p>2. Security (your linter shouldn&#x27;t have complete access to your computer and network): Deno hasn&#x27;t done a great job with this, either. You can restrict the access that a Deno process has, but you can&#x27;t restrict the access for individual modules. If any module in your server needs to access something, then every module in your server can access it.<p>I predict that module-level authorizations will be solved some day by browser vendors, and that Node and Deno will adopt the thing. Deno will probably have to throw out their thing what that happens.<p>3. Build system (GYP). This has no effect on userland Node developers. You build node with make. Another build system could be adopted, but I think nobody&#x27;s bothered. Deno has a protobuf FFI to communicate with V8. You can do that with Node if you want. Shrug.<p>4. require(&quot;package&quot;) relies on package.json. Deno uses import maps. Node will probably honor import maps someday, too.<p>5. node_modules: He said it &quot;complicates the module resolution algorithm.&quot; Meh. He also points out that node_modules is too large, but that&#x27;s a Node cultural problem. Deno&#x27;s community is still small, but it will have that problem, too, except it will have a large shared &quot;cache&quot; instead of a large local node_modules folder.<p>6. require(&quot;module&quot;) without the extension &quot;.js&quot;: Deno does this, too, using import maps. It&#x27;s fine.<p>7. index.js: Again, it &quot;complicated the module loading system.&quot; Meh?",,dfabulich,,1603469801,2020-10-23T16:16:41Z,comment,24871055,24870759,,,

,,"This isn&#x27;t as serious of a proposal as some of the W3C documents on how XML and WS-* works with my name on it (among many, many other smarter people)... and I have a lot of sympathy for someone who had to deal with Win32 APIs (they are locally optimized but globally bad).<p>I have no love for XML, but the details tend to matter.  And you are right that saying &quot;use HTTP&quot; is a bit hand-wavy.  XML is great at serializing <i>nouns</i> when you want to enforce the schema of those nouns.  It makes interop of nouns, verifying, quantifying, and some types of searches must faster and consistent.  XML was a reaction to widespread RPC and endless bit-order compat that wasted so many lines of code.  It comes from the same mindset as the people who made SQL -- &quot;conforming to schemas is good and what most people want.&quot;<p>However, in the last 10 years we&#x27;ve seen that it isn&#x27;t possible to conform to a single schema as requirements change, and that is why XML has generally lost favor to JSON.  This is a similar reason why NoSQL wins in many cases over SQL.<p>HTTP, in contrast to XML, is a set of <i>verbs</i> (called methods) and <i>identifiers</i> (typically urls), which is similar to what a file system is.  It leaves the <i>nouns</i> (the body in HTTP) to the application, but it does promote some properties (headers in HTTP) and have conventions for common properties (content-type).  The big difference between HTTP and most file systems is that HTTP is stateless, whereas many file operations are stateful (get a handle to a stream, write to a stream, close the stream).<p>HTTP would work as the API for a file system because it provides pretty good addresses for both local and remote and relatively low-level operations.<p>HTTP also has the benefit of being widely adopted, even during the Cairo development, which would have solved the chicken-and-the-egg problem from the first essay.<p>Using HTTP as a file system has key drawbacks: Applications would have to be re-written to use both the new APIs and new mindset of possibly high-latency operations.  You can&#x27;t always assume that a particular endpoint will be available, unlike many assumptions about inodes.<p>So, do I think they <i>should</i> have done this?  Maybe, there were a lot of variables at play.  But, I don&#x27;t think it is a crazy idea to use HTTP as the file system, and I predict we will see a popular -- nay, credible -- operating system use it within the next 5 years.<p><i>And I also think it&#x27;s telling that even in the post-mortem hindsight, the author fails to see alternatives that were widely available in the industry because they weren&#x27;t invented at Microsoft.</i>",,yajoe,,1387069124,2013-12-15T00:58:44Z,comment,6907828,6907262,,,

Locally a makerspace is slowly bootstrapping itself and once its further along, I&#x27;ll join and meet some interesting people soon (the pioneers of the group only meet while I&#x27;m busy at work, so occasional mailing list interaction is possible, although not in person).<p>One hardware job interview a long time ago involved pulling circuit boards of stuff I designed and built at home out of my suit pockets during the interview.  The HR lady was stunned, and I was also stunned to hear that she was stunned.  Admittedly I was bringing analog to a digital gunfight but still... they&#x27;re looking for a hardware dude, and I got interviewed because I know a guy, but none of the guys you selected by yourselves personally own a soldering iron, and you&#x27;re hiring for a HARDWARE guy?  If HR screws up that badly, which happens often enough, if you can find any way at all to get in, you&#x27;ll basically be the only candidate.  There are probably ways for HR to do this with software, maybe HR ends up only providing java candidates but they actually need a Ruby guy and you&#x27;re a Ruby guy and via an old friend you get interviewed, well, I guess you win.",,VLM,,1378900686,2013-09-11T11:58:06Z,comment,6366593,6365783,,,
,,"I predict that 0.10.x will be with us for a long time. It&#x27;s now the Windows XP SP2 of Node.js releases. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how long it takes before Joyent <i>refuses</i> to accept patches to the 0.10.x branch. When they do, that&#x27;ll be the point to seriously consider moving off of Node.js to a project with adults running it.<p>In addition to all of the political crap with Joyent, the changes in 0.12.x are incredibly onerous at the C++ level, for no obvious benefit whatsoever (thanks, v8 team). I know our company is sticking with 0.10.x for the indefinite future because we&#x27;re not allocating man power to update the dozen or so compiled node modules we use (along with all of the new bugs changing that many changes will inevitably bring with it).<p>Instead, in the future we&#x27;ll be dropping down to either libuv directly (all of our compiled libraries are written in C–C++ is just used to bind to Node.js), and we&#x27;re also looking carefully at luvit, since Lua binds to C so nicely, and LuaJIT is seriously awesome. :)<p>So between Joyent forcing Ben Noordhuis out and their corporate &quot;it&#x27;s our way or the highway&quot; bullshit, we just have a really bad taste in our mouths about the future of Node.js with Joyent at the helm.",,erichocean,,1389925140,2014-01-17T02:19:00Z,comment,7073895,7073044,,,
Ask HN: How much do you pay for cloud service each month?,,"Hello hackers,<p>I'm working on my first app, which uses a cloud service as the back-end. I never seriously thought about cost until recently I talked to a friend, who is about to release his photo app. He told me that it is very easy to spend $200k per month on an app.<p>I think this is a shocking number, consider many apps can't be profitable at beginning (instagram/twitter). I can't afford to release an app if it will cost me that much.<p>I have no experience of managing an app, nor can I predict the cost. Before I decided to post this, I did check some online articles comparing cloud pricing. But those pricing numbers are very obscure without concrete examples. I want to see some data points like this:<p>type of app: phone app (or website)<p>choice of cloud service: Amazon EC2 (or app engine/ heroku/ Azure/ parse)<p>userbase: 500k<p>data types: both text and binary file (image, video ...)<p>monthly cost: $200k<p>I know it really depends on the app, and a well-written code can significantly reduce cost. But I just want to have some rough idea.  To be frank, my budget for maintaining my app is $1000/month at most. I don't know what kind of userbase I can support with that kind of money. Or must I be founded by VC?",,stewie2,4,1343095363,2012-07-24T02:02:43Z,story,4283961,,10,,
