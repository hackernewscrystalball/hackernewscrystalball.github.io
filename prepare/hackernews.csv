I ran my own business for 7 years, making content websites monetized through google adsense, building games, and freelancing, among other things. The primary source of revenue was adsense, and it paid the bills enough for me not to need a &quot;real job&quot; for years. 18 months ago, the adsense revenue started to dry up, and in an effort to make some additional income, I started looking for a normal job again.<p>I ended up reluctantly taking a job working for the State of California, mostly because the schedule was flexible and it was a 5 minute commute. In the last 18 months I&#x27;ve gotten two promotions, including one four months after I started which is unheard of in state service (and which my bosses had to fight HR to get). I spearheaded the acquisition and implemented of a version control system, which no one hear had ever used (they were just FTPing files all the time, risking overwriting of others&#x27; work etc), and got buy-in from all the developers who now say they couldn&#x27;t imagine working without it. I also now wear a variety of hats besides programming including sysadmin work, dba work, architecture design, etc. My bosses rely on me more and more everyday just for my opinions and advice, let alone the work I do.<p>Yet now, when I send out my resume, it&#x27;s almost always crickets.  A year and a half ago, when the first item on my work experience list was &quot;failed entrepreneurship&quot;, the response rate to my resume was about 80% (not even talking about interviews, just getting a response at all).  Now it&#x27;s more like 20%, all because the first item in my work experience section is my current job working in public service.<p>I admit, many of my coworkers probably deserve the reputation that public sector work has. A significant number of them are clock-watchers that the bosses don&#x27;t even try to assign anything important to, because they know they don&#x27;t give a shit and can&#x27;t easily be fired (union), they are just filling a chair waiting for their public pension to accumulate over 20-30 years.  Nevertheless, I also list on my resume all of the above, including the pioneering (for us) work I&#x27;ve accomplished here implementing version control etc.  I never intended to stay here more than a couple of years, but I also never intended for this job to have such a negative impact on my job prospects.<p>I think I am probably going to revise my resume to leave this job off completely, and just say I&#x27;ve been working for myself for 9 years instead of 7.

The fact that you <i>can</i> write software that provably satisfies a strict specification in dependently typed languages doesn&#x27;t mean that you <i>must</i>. It is perfectly possible to program in them like you would in a normal language. That&#x27;s what I was trying to get at: dependent types are also more expressive, not just more constraining. Now that I know about dependent types I regularly run into situations where I think &quot;gosh, if I had dependent types I wouldn&#x27;t have had to put in these type casts or handle these error cases that I know for sure cannot happen&quot;.<p>So even if you ultimately want to reason about your programs using an external program logic (which I predict we do not, but we&#x27;ll see), then for expressiveness you <i>still</i> want your language to have dependent types for the reason I mentioned above:<p>&gt; Two, type system researchers promote provably correct programming as the advantage of dependent types. IMO the far more important advantage of dependent types is expressiveness and simplicity: they generalize a vast swath of different type system features and extensions to a handful of simple constructs.<p>Furthermore, if you want it&#x27;s possible to use a program logic style of verification in a dependent type system. You can write your program as normal and later prove lemmas about functions in the program. For instance instead of saying<p><pre><code>    reverse : Vec n a -&gt; Vec n a
</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>    reverse : (xs : List a) -&gt; {ys : List a | length xs == length ys}

you can do<p><pre><code>    reverse : List a -&gt; List a

I predict that the 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10 configuration as the first throw has a higher success rate than as a second throw.<p>Reason? Players who end up with that second shot must have completely missed the first shot. Good players will occasionally get there (if you wait long enough you will even find a pro throwing it, maybe because he suffers a stroke during play), but bad players will get there disproportionally more often. Of all such second shots, 90+% may be played by the bottom 50% of players.<p>Similarly, I think the 7-8-9-10 that isn&#x27;t in this dataset isn&#x27;t impossible.

The end game will have Oracle having a controlling position in every aspect of Enterprise software development.<p>First of all, Oracle has removed InnoDB from the MySQL Classic Edition. Now, you can still get the GPL community edition that has InnoDB in it.  But if you want support, you’ll have to buy their version.  Oh, and they just raised the price on that.  I’m not sure if they require it or not, but if you use Linux Oracle prefers that you run their software on THEIR version of Linux – a customized Red Hat.  This week they also released plans for the JVM that will include a free version and a premium paid version.  Oh, and if you want some new hardware that will really make it all work well together, they can sell you that too (they bought Sun, remember?).<p>So it’s pretty clear to me that Oracle is playing for keeps, and playing to own the Enterprise space.  Want to use a database?   Buy Oracle, or use MySQL… but if you want support, you pay them.  Then you pay them for Linux.   Then license the JVM.  Then license the app server (they bought BEA last year, so WebLogic is all theirs now too).  Want to code in Java?  Well, they own that too.  Business folks call this “owning the vertical.”<p>Watch for them to take even more steps to make sure that they have control points around as many places they can.  Nearly all software that gets written is business application software.  Clearly Oracle has been embedded firmly there for a long time – but these moves are enveloping and will sink hooks into so many more places.   I predict that when Google and Oracle settle – and they will eventually, since the cost to litigate a huge patent battle does no good for either party – that Oracle will get some hooks into mobile as well.  Maybe some email integration, or provisioning, or something deep and fundamental.<p>So watch out, stay alert, and think about your tools.  Or you too will be assimilated.",1878341,,,0

Let's also say that Pensions R Us has decided to sell 50% of the average daily volume of a regional sporting goods retailer over the next 2 days.  If QFundA's model strongly suggests that the price is going up over the week, QFundA may slowly take on those shares over 2 days (and hedge against big news using out of the money puts), followed by slowly selling them off over the following 2 trading days to market participants who weren't interested a few days earlier.  QFundA has made money by smoothing out prices (and likely reducing the bid-ask spread).  Pensions R Us gets a better average price than they would have otherwise, as QFundA's buying activity has offset the market impact of Pensions R Us's selling activity.<p>Impatient/risk adverse market participants may have lower average returns because of QFundA's activities, but perhaps they're more than happy to pay a few basis points in order to get into or out of their positions faster.  It's entirely possible that QFundA only slightly reduces average returns of other market participants while greatly reducing volatility, and thus bringing up everyone else's Sharpe ratios.  In other words, when you take into account the fact that volatility/risk pays a big role in the utility functions of most market participants, it's possible that everyone wins, despite QFundA providing ""zero value added"" from the narrow viewpoint that only looks at the long-term price prediction provided by long-term ""fundamentals"" investors.<p>QFundA's strategy could still be summarized as ""I know [predict high probability that] somebody else will buy X, so let's buy X first and sell it to them at a higher price"", and yet QFundA provides real value to the market as a whole.<p>There are some predatory strategies that don't provide any value to other market participants.

Lacking this technology one instead must fall to &quot;frameworks&quot; as the unit of shared community development.<p>This is directly related to one&#x27;s ability to spin off a library containing a generalizable component of functionality and have it be repeatedly reused.

Actually, worse than that, most languages and the style of their libraries as supported by the community cause tradeoffs which penalize reusability quite harshly.<p><pre><code>    * It&#x27;s difficult to manage documentation of interfaces

Experienced Haskell users often talk about this story: that Haskell was the first language they ever used which actually felt reusable. This arose from the combination of powerful types, pure code, and laziness. The types provide clear, unbreakable interfaces between libraries. The purity ensures that libraries play together well and can be combined in more ways due to no &quot;spooky interaction at a distance&quot;. The laziness ensures that when you cut sequences of computation into pieces you can recompose them later without losing efficiency.<p>I&#x27;m not going to claim that Haskell has figured out modularity, but I do think it&#x27;s massively better than the status quo here. The upshot is that Cabal Hell is in part caused by the fact that nobody quite knows how to handle such massive modularity in practice.<p>Where that&#x27;s relevant, I think, to this post is that without a genuine case for reusable modularity—supported at the language and the community levels—it is much harder to invest your time into reusable things and instead you focus efforts on frameworks. Lacking the technology to have legos we choose between prefab houses.<p>I think the best way for Javascript, i.e., to move forward away from framework driven development is to double down on the community&#x27;s investment in purity as neither types nor laziness are ever going to be core to the language. This has already occurred in a small way with things like the virtual dom technique (which can be easily made immutable and updated purely) and the rise of things like Mori and Immutable.js.<p>As this pattern grows I predict the ability for people to genuinely build applications from well-cut, reusable components will become far more of a reality and the &quot;framework epoch&quot; will slowly close.",9314636,,,4

Look at <a href=""http://semver.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;semver.org&#x2F;</a> (not related to Haskell at all) and you&#x27;ll see that the very first point on the page is about incompatible API changes.  So clearly this issue exists outside of Haskell and people have developed methods for managing it with version bound schemes.  You are arguing against rapidly changing software, not against upper bounds.  In your example where the Django server is not making backwards-incompatible changes, upper bounds wouldn&#x27;t hurt you at all because the bounds are on the major version number, but exploit fixes that don&#x27;t break backwards compatibility will only bump the minor version number.<p>Comparing Haskell to any other mainstream language in this discussion is invalid because the other languages have been around a lot longer and have reached a more stable state.  Python appeared in 1991.  The first Haskell standard appeared in 1998.  So that means Python has at least 7 years of stability on Haskell.  I would argue that Haskell gained adoption much more slowly because it is much less similar to any mainstream language that came before it, so the actual number should be larger.  Paul Graham&#x27;s essay &quot;The Python Paradox&quot; came out in 2004.  I would suggest that Haskell is just now getting close to the point that Python was at when PG wrote that essay.  That means that Python has at least 10 years on Haskell.  So if you&#x27;re comparing breaking changes in Haskell today with Python, you need to compare it with Python as it was 10 years ago.  If you think the breaking changes are not worth that much pain for you, then don&#x27;t use Haskell right now.  But you shouldn&#x27;t make that decision without educating yourself about the benefits the language has to offer.  For me, it is a small price to pay compared to the benefits I get from Haskell.<p>Only time will tell, but I predict that companies based solely on Haskell will emerge in a few years dominating their competition because they can write better quality software, iterate faster, with fewer people, more reuse, fewer bugs, and easier maintenance than companies not using Haskell.",7479202,,,0

This usually involves examining the relationship between test scores and first-year college grades, generally expressed as the correlation coefficient (or r value). The College Board's Handbook for the SAT Program 2000-2001 claims the SAT-V and SAT-M have a correlation of .47 and .48, respectively, with freshman GPA (FGPA). This number is deceptive, however. To determine how much of the difference in first-year grades between students the SAT I really predicts, the correlation coefficient must be multiplied by itself. The result, called r squared, describes the difference (or variation) among college freshman grades. Thus, the predictive ability (or r squared) of the SAT I is just .22, meaning the test explains only 22% of the variation in freshman grades. With a correlation of .54, high school grades alone do a better job, explaining almost 30% of the variance in first-year college performance.""<p><a href=""http://www.fairtest.org/facts/satvalidity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fairtest.org/facts/satvalidity.html</a>",157395,,,0

Fully autonomous R&#38;D-capable AIs (AKA self-improving that is, a problem-solving / reasoning system, that is capable of creating new, and improving upon existing problem-solving / reasoning systems -which, coincidently, might include itself) are the modern equalent of the philosopher's stone, and has not only withstanded attacks in ways that few other problem domains did, but seems to be an AI-hard[1] problem by itself.

Even if pauses are rare enough as not to affect 95-pctile latency (or if you don&#x27;t care about 95-th pctile latency) in a highly-available system they introduce one of the more nasty distributed systems failures -- node A talks to node B and goes into a GC pause; node B thinks node A is dead, node A thinks node B is dead -- because when it didn&#x27;t receive a reply to its outstanding requests until after it emerged from a GC pause triggering a timeout (all in the mean while certain figures from RDBMS community insist this didn&#x27;t actually occur because &quot;partitions never happen in a single datacenter...&quot;)<p>While it&#x27;s very much possible to directly allocate and manage memory yourself in Java -- and I have done that ( <a href=""http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hbase-commits/201306.mbox/%3C20130613181824.1A81E23889ED@eris.apache.org%3E"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mail-archives.apache.org&#x2F;mod_mbox&#x2F;hbase-commits&#x2F;20130...</a> ) -- but without memory safety guarantees, without the great tooling, without the general idea that &quot;if your code compiles, it  will probably work correctly&quot;. In other words, you&#x27;re programming a very verbose and ugly (see DirectByteBuffer interface) C. There&#x27;s many cases where this approach (&quot;off-heap memory&quot;) makes sense when building memory intensive apps in Java that clearly benefit everywhere else from being written in Java: JNI is unpleasant to work with, JNA adds additional performance penalties on top of those imposed by JNI calls that it makes under the cover -- which is fine in many cases, but remember that reading files or sockets are also JNI calls -- but less so when you&#x27;re building a system that distinguishes itself by being in memory.<p>On the other hand, if you use C (or &quot;C+&quot; a.k.a. &quot;C with objects&quot;, or -- as I prefer to say to avoid confusion with libraries like glib or apr or the Linux vfs layer, all successful object oriented systems written in regular C -- &quot;C with templates&quot;) you have accesses to the existing works (advanced allocators like jemalloc and tcmalloc don&#x27;t work very well with JVM), excellent memory-debugging tools, and so on...<p>I will say this: I think <i>more</i> software rather than less should be written in higher level languages. I absolutely love OCaml, Erlang, and Lisps (especially those -- like Typed Racket and Clojure -- that have started importing features from Haskell&#x2F;ML family), like what I see in Go. I use Python (and formerly Perl) on a daily basis for &quot;casual programming&quot;, to experiment with new ideas, and automation. I&#x27;ve written a great deal of software in Java, where many people blinked the idea that this category of software could be more than a toy in Java. I think garbage collection could be great improved and I see no theoretical reasons why, e.g., compilers can&#x27;t be written in OCaml as opposed to C or C++ (I do see practical reasons having to do with runtime, lack of multi-core support but that&#x27;s a separate and fixable issue). I find projects aimed at making systems programming in high-level languages fascinating (e.g., Mirage OS, Microsoft&#x27;s experiments, Jikes RVM, etc...)<p>However, even if these theoretical strides are achieved, there&#x27;s always going to be room for C -- in the end, you need systems that give you great deal of control and act in a very deterministic and predictable fashion . In the mean while, however, there&#x27;s also need to build practical systems -- so while C and C++ may not be ideal in theory, they are often the only realistic option in practice.<p>[1] Note, however, I didn&#x27;t say anything about performance -- OCaml, Java, Haskell, LuaJit etc.. do well in the Debian benchmarks; Lisps follow those languages closely. Likewise, many high-level languages can be AOT compiled. While when written by a strong programmer and&#x2F;or assisted by today&#x27;s excellent optimizing compilers C will still beat these fast high-level languages in most cases, it should be noted that today it&#x27;s extremely difficult to write assembly code by hand that beats assembly code written by an optimizing C compiler or even the JVM. I predict that when a language comes about that has a better designed type system than C&#x2F;C++ and yet still provides ability to control memory layout much as C does, eventually compilers for that language will emit assembly code that beats assembly emitted by C compilers for the same reason compiler-written assembly beats hand-written assembly -- compiler is able to leverage the type information (declared or -- in the case of dynamically typed languages with fast runtimes -- inferred) to aid optimization.",6861751,,,0

In my opinion, it’s because of 3 reasons:<p>1. The action-effect feedback cycle is almost instantaneous<p>2. Your long-term goals are well defined and easy to hold in your active memory(gear, skill spec, kill this boss etc)<p>3. The connection between those goals and your immediate actions is very clear. If you need 200k DPS to farm act whatever and you are at 180k then you need to find such and such item with such and such specs and the optimal farming route for your level is this one so let’s get this shit done!<p>A well designed computer game is like a Waterfall project manager’s wet dream. End outcome is very clear(farm level X in Y minutes), the process of getting there is well described(guides, almost all game variables are numerical and their interactions are simple to model), and the acceptance test is obvious(I am farming level X in Y minutes, or I am too slow or I am plain dying and&#x2F;or not doing enough damage).<p>I think you need to bring your development process and gaming closer together.<p>In terms of the feedback loop use tests and todos. If your tests are failing you know you’re not done, if your todos are falling behind, you know you’re not done. Have some automated performance&#x2F;acceptance tests, I find seeing simulated user behavior being successful as much more satisfying than internal unit stuff. This is likely what you do anyway, so the problem is probably at the long-term level:<p>Do you have a clear outcome in mind? Do you have a clear path to that outcome? Is what you are doing at a given moment helping you achieve that outcome? Do you have a connection in your mind between delivering your project and achieving your life goals? Is working for yourself really what you want? Will you be happier in 30 days for having written the bit of code you are writing right now?<p>Try and answer those questions based on what you feel about the question not on whether saying you prefer gaming to programming means you are a good or bad person.<p>Plan more! Connect your day-to-day coding to your project’s big picture. Make a list of features&#x2F;tasks that are left to do before a project is ‘done’ and go over it every day before and after you start the day. What did you cross off that day? Where has progress been made? How much work is left over? Does the overall plan need to be adjusted?<p>Finally, reprogram your view of gaming. Every time you accomplish something in a game write down this: ‘Today I managed to get a 12 win in Hearthstone with a Mage deck. I earned 300 gold, a card pack with a Leroy and some junk in it, and $0. I predict that this will contribute to me earning $0 going forward.’ Money isn’t everything, but it’s not nothing either.<p>Do the same for programming tasks. Make a note every time you do git commits, for instance. Every little task will STILL be worth $0 immediately, but the end will be different: ‘I wrote the authentication module for my new project, fixing a security issue with token-based auth. I improved the speed at which users get past the login process by 30%(.65 seconds) and it’ll be easy to move the module to a mobile back-end API later on. I predict that this will contribute to me earning $nice_chunk_of_money going forward.’<p>At the most fundamental level there is one difference between casual gaming and programming: human beings value one of those activities enough to transfer some of their resources to you in exchange for having you help them. The other one makes it obvious when you level up.<p>Source: this is how I got through college and got myself to actually improve and use my programming skills. Good luck.",7536283,,,3

I understand the rationale behind this decision, however instead of improving their browser&#x27;s permissions system, instead of doing a better job reviewing all those crappy extensions that turn to mallware over night (e.g. Window Resizer - and btw, Mozilla is doing a much better job), instead of all of that, they decide to drop the ability to install extensions from third-party source. I predict a similar change will also come for Android. Because grandmas need protection of course.<p>For several months now I have been torn between Chrome and Firefox, not able to decide which I like better, switching back and forth depending on mood. Well, I guess this settles it. I was already using Firefox on my Android exclusively, because it&#x27;s the only mobile browser that has extensions, whereas Google decided that extensions are a nuisance on Android and even if they don&#x27;t admit it, they probably hate the idea of AdBlock making it to Android.<p>Chrome has had a positive effect on the marketplace, but now the negative effects are starting to show up. Adobe for instance decided to drop the support they had for Flash on Linux and only support Chrome, so at present and going forward, if you want the latest Flash on Linux, you&#x27;ve got to use Chrome. My answer was just to disable it of course.<p>But do we really want a monoculture? Haven&#x27;t we had enough with IExplorer 5&#x2F;6? Are we really that dumb?<p>Either way, at the very least Chrome fans should start using Chromium, because the Chrome binary is not open-source and if you use it, you won&#x27;t realize the true difference&#x2F;cost between it and the competition. For example the PDF reader bundled in Chrome is something proprietary, whereas Mozilla bundled a PDF reader that&#x27;s open-source, built in Javascript and that also works in Chromium - you see, whenever Mozilla does something, it usually benefits everybody.",7237725,,,6

America was certainly left holding the bag all right, and perhaps it took a long time to sink in the reasons that the Europeans had been so eager to hand it over. Truth is, no one country should be holding that bag, which is why a proper UN (not necessarily the UN we have today) is so desirable and inevitable. Hopefully the USA, realising that playing the role of global policeman is not the fun career it envisaged in its youth, will come to realise that a supranational pseudo-government is actually a very good idea.

As well as that they also have an interesting team behind them as well for instance their CEO Thejo Kote, was previously a founder of NextDrop[1] which provides <i>real</i> value to people in India by informing them when nearby water is available (In case you’re not aware of this, despite having water pipes to them, water in India is only available for a few hours (usually once or twice a week) at a time and they have no way of knowing when that time actually is).<p>The product is useful for some of the reasons listed on their website such as the Crash Alert, Engine Health, Where You Parked etc. Although the biggest interest they will receive is through, external parties such as Rental Companies and Car Insurance providers etc (In otherwords, I predict their market is far bigger on the business than the Consumer side although, in some instances they overlap). The Car Insurance feature may actually become their biggest ‘feature’ for consumers in the future going forward “With Automatic you can get an Engine Health Check, Remember Where You Parked, In The Event of a Crash Inform the Right People and more importantly save $100’s on your Car Insurance!”<p>For instance, in the UK there are a lot of car insurance providers who give discounts to drivers who get a telematics policy aka install a “black box” within their car (something similar to Automatic without the additional features). These telematics policies in the UK are offered in 3 categories (the Behaviour-Based is the most common):<p>- Curfew-Based Policies – if you don’t drive between 11pm – 5am you get a discount<p>- Low Mileage Policies<p>- Behaviour-Based Policies (which Automatic does with their “Drive Score”  points system) which considers how will you corner, brake and speed etc so the better you drive your insurance becomes cheaper, you drive badly you get penalised with higher rates etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nextdrop.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nextdrop.org</a>",5362265,,,11

This was due to two factors:<p>1. A lot of the low-hanging fruit had been answered so the questions became increasingly esoteric such that you were less likely to simply know an answer and had to spend more time researching. That extra time meant you were also less <i>rewarded</i> for the answer because less people were in a position to state that it was correct or not (if you consider karma a ""reward""); and<p>2. The ceaseless campaign against ""interesting"" questions due to increasing closure due to ""subjective and argumentative"" and the fragmentation of SO into the many StackExchange sites (causing a lot of questions to be migrated).<p>There are three basic errors that Joel has (and Jeff had) made (IMHO):<p>1. Over-emphasis on editing.<p>In my mind there are three groups: askers, answerers and editors. Jeff &#38; Joel made statements about editors are important and how editing is super-important, basically trying o elevate it to the same level as answering questions.<p>This is a problem.<p>Editors are the bureaucrats of the StackOverflow ecosystem. The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy [3]. The more editors you have the less each has to do. Rather than doing less, the kinds of people attracted to this kind of function prefer to simply <i>create</i> work for themselves.<p>What's more, from Meta StackOverflow, from interacting from the people who edit a lot (and answer very little if anything), this simply reinforced my view: these are the kinds of people who destroy communities.<p>Those who can, answer. Those who can't, edit.<p>I've seen many spurious edits to many of my higher voted answers. Some capitalize something. Others come along and uncapitalize it. I've seen people come and add lines to my answers saying I stole it from someone else (seriously).<p>The net result is virtually any highly voted answer I have has been edited into community wiki oblivion. That creates a strong disincentive for me to spend time coming up with a good answer: I'll basically get limited credit from it and then have to watch as wanna-be editors essentially vandalize it.<p>The other thing these people do is close questions on the drop of a hat. They, as a group, tend to have an incredibly festidious nature when it comes to the enforcement of rules. They constantly seek some purer, higher standard and don't quite get that those rules are <i>guidelines</i> that are a means to an end and not an end in themselves.<p>2. ""Subjective and argumentative"".<p>Jeff and Joel from the outset wanted to prevent flame war type questions, the kind of questions that have no definite answer. Questions like ""Is Ruby better than Python?"" That's fine but it's been taken too far, in part by the very editors I previously mentioned.<p>Questions like ""Should I use Angular.js or Ember.js for developing a CRUD-type Web application?"" would be shut down in a minute. But the extra context matters. You can answer that question by giving a list of comparative advantages without being necessarily biased or inflammatory. That's actually interesting content, particularly if you're trying to decide between a number of new technologies, languages, etc. But alas SO seems keen on shutting that down; and<p>3. Fragmentation.<p>There is another thread today about the difficulty of music classification [4]. The same goes for Q&#38;A. Hierarchical classification schemes are too limited for Q&#38;A. There are SO questions that have bounced around between a number of SE sites for this reason.<p>Just look at the Stack Exchange sites [5]. If I want to ask a question about being a programmer do I ask on OnStartups, on the Programmer SE or elsewhere?<p>The pragmatic answer is that there are some question that naturally fit on several sites. Yet the hierarchical pigeon-holing with esoteric and often subjective rules means it's harder to find content, it's hard to find where to place content and newbies inevitably get chastised for posting on the wrong site.<p>There is a reason tagging exists and is successful. Describe the traits of the question or, better yet, figure it out from the content, and show it when it's relevant to someone. Don't make me hunt across sites for it. That's a ridiculous solution.<p>I predict you'll see the rise of more tagging-oriented (at a higher level than say Java or C++) and automatic classification Q&#38;A sites in the future.<p>With that out of my system, let me address som eof the points the OP specifically raised:<p>&#62; The Eternal September Issue.<p>This one annoys me. And I don't mean new people. The negative reaction people have to them (eg [6]). When a community starts chastising newbies, that reflects badly on the community, not the newbies.<p>&#62; Down voting as a means of closing a question.<p>The one part of downvoting I don't like is people use it as a means of saying ""I disagree with this"" (on purely subjective grounds), which is not the intended purpose. That problem seems to be nearly universal with voting systems (even here). The one good thing SO does is ""charge"" you for downvotes. That alone stops it being a huge problem (IMHO).<p>&#62; This is another one of the odd cases on StackOverflow. A few of the “Exact Duplicate” questions are not duplicates due to minor, but important, differences.<p>True. The problem here again is that you have editors deciding to close things that they don't necessarily know anything about. The same problem infests Wikipedia (deleting articles on ""notability"" grounds).<p>&#62; The value of reputation: After the global recalculation, the site’s creators made a bold statement that participation is not valued on the site.<p>I actually don't know what this is referring to but then again I've been largely inactive. There have been several recalculations though (eg question upvotes from 10 to 5 karma). I don't really have a problem with this. If you're too obsessed with your karma, you're focusing on the wrong things. And I like that the same rules apply to everyone (eg it's better than question upvotes before X are 10, after X are 5).<p>I worried when SO took VC money that they were going to turn something that is very successful in one segment and ruin it with attempts at making a general Q&#38;A platform. 2+ years on I'm still failing to see traction in the SE sites beyond SO. This may yet still become a problem.<p>Perhaps the simplest answer here is that SO isn't a ""community"" as such. It went with the Q&#38;A format (over, say, forums) to discourage discussion. People often criticized it for making discussion hard when that was kinda the point.<p>I certainly never went to SO to hang out. Some do I'm sure. The focus is (and should be IMHO) on the content not the community.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4413684"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4413684</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/18393/cletus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/users/18393/cletus</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/130452-the-bureaucracy-is-expanding-to-meet-the-needs-of-the"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/130452-the-bureaucracy-is-ex...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4493959"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4493959</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/sites"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackexchange.com/sites</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/9953/could-we-please-be-a-bit-nicer-to-new-users"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/9953/could-we-please...</a>",4494016,,,4

I think the dedicated portable game device is probably dead.<p>In many ways, that is the beauty of Shield. It isn't a dedicated gaming device, it runs stock Android and has controller buttons built in. Sure, the platform isn't a great idea if you <i>aren't</i> going to game on it, but it can easily function as a general purpose tablet outside of gaming. I am certain one of the analog sticks on shield will behave like swiping for the purposes of app emulation. It would be nice for reading web pages. It also can act as a netflix machine, or any movie or audio player. PSVita doesn't have that luxury.<p>The other reason to put more faith in the Shield than Vita is that targeting Shield targets 70% of the phone market and 30% of the tablet market. It targets a platform that will continue to grow, and you release your game not as an in-store one time purchase physical flash memory card but off the Play Store and as such will be a continuous source of revenue (despite Play games selling for significantly less than console counterparts, but I imagine dedicated Android gaming platform owners will buy games).<p>&#62; Ouya -- breakout success for them would be getting 1% of the market. Which they may get. It'll be niche at best.<p>They won't even get that. The Ouya succeeds not if they move a lot of units but if games developed for Android start supporting hardware controllers. As soon as that happens, the Ouya isn't niche at all, and games that target Android and work on it just make it a positive value proposition to complement other Android devices you already have. It runs reskinned Android though, so I don't know if it as capable as a Shield as a general media device.<p>&#62; I will let you know right now what can totally change the tide in gaming... Oculus Rift (and VR headset in general). Seems easier to pull off then the MS Illumiroom and would provide a more immersive scenario. If a platform can pull this off at a reasonable price point ($99/headset max) -- I predict they win.<p>I'd like to see the OR work out too, but I think the market for VR headsets isn't that big. It is comparable to 3d tvs, albeit less gimmicky in most ways. I don't see myself going out of my way to stick on a helmet to play Doom 3. Then again, I didn't like the ideas behind motion controllers either, so I'm probably just outside that demographic. I like moving pictures with some buttons to press to make things happen.",5051271,,,0

I remember how the closed garden that Microsoft tried to create was frowned upon. Small companies that were picking the Internet as a delivery platform and using open-source/multi-platform technologies were on the forefront of innovation. Of course regular consumers and businesses never cared, but as Paul Graham once said, if you want to see the future trends in computing, you have to look at what hackers are using today.<p>Then OS X happened, this UNIX-compatible OS that was shiny and cool and all of your UNIX tools were compatible with it and you could run some pretty important proprietary software too, like MS Office or Photoshop. It was more productive for developers than Windows. Compared to Linux it was friendlier to all people. And suddenly Apple was hip again and it slowly captured the hearts of developers.<p>Then the iPhone happened and people didn't mind that it was a closed garden, because there has never been anything like it. Anything that Apple allowed on this new platform, it was taken as a gift, as it was their platform, so if they wanted to ban an app for ""duplicating existing functionality"" then openness be damned, it was their product after all. Then the stories about lone developers getting rich on the App Store happened, and people didn't mind being at the behest of Apple, as long as they could have some piece of that awesome pie.<p>Of course, countless of reasons were given by tech pundits, trying to rationalize the walled garden they've created - it is better for grandmas that have their PCs ridden with viruses, it is better for the protection of our children, it exposes computing to a wider mass (even though computing in this context means mostly consumption), it solves the problem of app marketing for individual developers without huge marketing budgets, etc... there's always some reason for why Apple was right to act the way it did. Even now that they've released a shitty GMaps replacement, some genuinely believe that they had no choice, when for a company like Apple there are always choices available.<p>Let's not forget for a moment the ultimate argument against this closed garden: if you don't like it, you are free to go somewhere else.<p>And now Apple started suing left and right, which in my opinion is what companies do when finding themselves in the innovator's dilemma, and is doing so while dropping the ball on new versions of its products. They are still successful and they might produce some more golden eggs in the future, but the innovation frenzy of the iPod era is over and they know it.<p>And yet people still cheer for them, even though as far as openness is concerned, Apple makes Microsoft look good. And it was only 12 years ago that people hated Microsoft with a passion for being an obstacle to innovation, even though Microsoft never banned any app from running on Windows or restricted its usage only to certain hardware (but surprise, since Apple has been doing it so successfully, Microsoft is going to start doing it with Windows 8 ... hurray for the renewed and totally not evil Microsoft).<p>I own an Android phone and an iPad. I love my iPad, but it was a gift and I secretly yearn for a Nexus tablet that has the same size + 3G.

Such monopolies are very dangerous and often inimical to property rights.  The very people who claim to defend property typically become the worst aggressors against it.  Specifically, my own property is far more vulnerable to seizure by government employees than by ordinary burglars.<p>I'm sorry if that sounds like anti-government propaganda, but it's the simple paintful truth of history and the current moment.<p>Ideally, people institute governments for the purpose of <i>protecting</i> individual life and property, but it just doesn't turn out that way.  After all, human beings are at the helm of such force monopolies, and it's generally unwise to trust human beings with that much power.<p>You wrote: <i>I am not sure if your definition of free market is really workable in practice (no coercion, people just respect each other etc.).</i><p>On the contrary, the non-initiation of aggression works <i>everywhere</i> that it is tried, all the time.  It happens billions of times per day, in homes, stores, and businesses all over the globe.  It is the <i>norm</i> -- so common that it goes unnoticed and unremarked.  Aggression and force are the exceptions, the deviations from the norm.<p>You wrote:  <i>So let me just ask again what I asked in another comment: are there cases in history where free markets have resolved a tragedy of the commons situation?</i><p>In a free market with strong property rights, there are no commons.  The tragedy of the commons arises where there are no clearly defined property rights.<p>To answer your question directly:  yes.  One example is the elephant population in Africa.  In areas without property rights, poaching abounds and the elephant population is decimated.  In areas with property rights, elephant populations triple.  There's no magic involved, and it happens for a simple reason:  property owners <i>want</i> lots of elephants to live on their property.  Wouldn't you?  You might say that the ""dirty little secret"" is that these property owners sell hunting licenses for $50K a pop to Teddy Roosevelt types to go in and bag some big game.  But what's so dirty about it if <i>fewer</i> elephants are killed and <i>more</i> elephants are born?  Do you want elephants or don't you?  ;)<p>You wrote: ""That was the original claim as I understood it: just let the markets run their course, and they'll fix the world's problems.""<p>I would rephrase that.  Just let <i>people</i> run their course without initiating aggression against each other, and they will fix the world's problems.  And when I put it that way, it seems obviously and trivially true.  But that is the definition of a free market after all, so it's not just a word game.<p>You might say that free markets are not ""workable"" because very few people will behave that way.  But as I point out, most people refrain from aggression against other people's property most of the time.  It's the norm.  Theft, murder, and rape are very rare and uncommon occurrences.  They only seem common because they get so much attention when they do occur.<p>You wrote: <i>villagers letting their sheep ruin the common grazing grounds. The solution was to set up fences, that is change the property rules - in my view a government intervention, not an achievement of the market</i><p>Not at all.  Those are achievements of free people trying their best to minimize conflict.  People don't like conflict and will try to minimize it on their own.  I suggest you read ""The Voluntary City"" for some historical examples of people doing amazing things, seemingly impossible in this day and age, without the ""magic"" of government, a.k.a. unilateral force and aggression against other people.  They even managed to build <i>roads</i> of all things -- the favorite example trotted out now as something only government can do.  And they weren't toll roads either.  Hard to imagine now, but it's so obvious when you see how they did it.<p>Common sheep grazing lands, and common fishing areas in the ocean, are all prime examples of tragedy of the commons.  Where there are no property rights, there is no motivation to preserve what's there.  It's just one giant ugly grab, indistinguishable from looting.<p>Perhaps you are arguing that <i>only</i> governments are capable of defending property rights, since only governments have the sufficient force to do so.  That's what Ayn Rand thought, and I think she's wrong about that.  I don't need to get into an argument about guns here, and here's why:  guns are a <i>last resort</i> when it comes to defending life and property.  Free and uncoerced people will try all sorts of things to avoid coming to that point.  Sociopaths don't care, but they are rare.  Most people will go to great lengths to maintain their reputation, which is why arbitration is so often effective.<p>I'm not going to address CO2 certificates, because to me that represents an externality that is extremely difficult to define in terms of specific offenders and victims.  CO2 is one of those things that animals must produce in order to survive.  I do think that the ""free market"", which again means any group of individuals interacting solely by mutual consent, are fully capable of dealing with any threat there.  Consider the vast changes in awareness of environmental issues over the last few decades.  Hell, these days it's <i>uncool</i> to throw cans in the trash and to waste energy.  This is social pressure, not the threat of physical force.<p>More people need to get more wealthy so they can afford a clean environment.  Poor people scrabbling in the dirt cannot afford to think about it.  And I predict that as the Chinese become more capitalized, they will innovate in manufacturing and energy production to reduce emissions of all sorts.  There's a simple reason for that.  Producing waste requires <i>energy</i>, and energy costs money.  But without capital, you cannot afford the innovation at the margin to clean up the processes.<p>Is the free market magic?  Will it lead to the Kingdom of God on earth?  Hell no.  But I am sick of hearing people extol the virtues of force monopolies, and how if they don't apply the lash, nobody will ever do anything right or worthwhile.  The reality is quite the opposite.",2658721,,,0

The SSL PKI has failed. Browser vendors allowed top-level CAs to delegate, often for money, their signing authority to third-parties. Those third parties have in turn done predictably horrible things with that privilege. One of them sold a CA=YES certificate to a Fortune 500 company to help them monitor their employees (and also the whole Internet). Several others were hacked.<p>The problem with untrustworthy CAs is that the browser depends on CA trust to ""break ties"" between competing certificate assertions; is this Bank of America certificate BofA, or is it a European organized crime group? The only signal the browser has is which CA the signature on the cert rolls up to.<p>Google ameliorated that problem for its own properties using ""certificate pinning"". Pinning simply means that Google knows what their legit certificates are, and ships a browser, and sure as shit isn't going to let its browser trust some dinky delegated CA's certificate for GMail over the certificate it knows it owns. It sure would be nice if everyone could pin their certificates into browsers instead of just Google and the giant sites Google pins.<p>TACK allows that to happen. TACK is a small cryptosystem that accomplishes for certificate pins what HSTS (a widely supported browser security standard) does for defeating SSL stripping: it provides a way for browsers to see a legit SSL/TLS certificate and then remember that certificate going forward, so even if Iranian hackers (or the NSA) manage to cut a valid-looking CA-signed certificate for that site later on, it won't matter because your browser will only honor the cert it first saw. The technique, which is called ""key continuity"" and forms the entire security model for SSH, relies on the fact that the overwhelming majority of first-contact hits to sites will get their legitimate key; if you're an attacker with an evil certificate, your odds of intercepting a first-touch connection from a browser to BofA is very low.<p>You very much want TACK to get as much attention as it can. Trevor Perrin and Moxie Marlinspike are extraordinarily competent and well-regarded crypto protocol people and TACK is both simple and well- thought- out. TACK takes some of the control maintained by browser vendors back and returns it to site operators. This kind of decentralization is badly needed. Read the TACK draft, please.",4613022,,,0

2093131,mitcheme,mitcheme,1294774778,2011-01-11T19:39:38Z,"Lifestyle inflation is very sneaky. I grew up fairly poor (and felt it), like trailer trash in a back-woods area known for potsmoking hicks poor, and now that I'm a ""starving college student"" with a decent PT job I feel pretty rich most of the time. I don't have the nicest apartment and I've parked my car for the year because the bus is cheaper and (usually) good enough. But even though I'm still not even middle class, I've noticed lifestyle inflation so I'm actively working to combat it. (Especially since I predict my income probably going up as I graduate and go FT year-round, I want the good habits now.)<p>Firstly I try to be frugal. Some people think this means cutting coupons for everything and not spending any money on fun things, but really it just means not spending money on things you don't care about, so that you can spend money on things you do care about instead. The exact categories there are different for everyone and will change over time and as your situation/environment changes. For me, I chose to give up the car so I could have more wiggle room wrt general spending money (eating out, coffee), and could afford a new laptop and glasses. Other people will bring their own lunches and coffee so they can afford a vacation, or cut down on buying electronics so they can live in a nicer place. Sometimes I fail at frugality -- recently I've spent a lot of money on videogames that I don't really enjoy and won't play much, when I already have unplayed ones and games with lots of leftover replay value. So for the next month, I'm not spending any money on videogames, and after that I'll try to think more carefully about whether I'll <i>enjoy</i> a game and whether I actually have a small enough pile of games to get around to it soon, rather than whether I can <i>afford</i> the game. Because for any individual game, the answer to that question is always YES, so it's not a helpful question to ask myself. You mentioned you drive nice carS -- does this mean you own/lease more than one at once? You can only drive one at a time, so unless you have a family with seriously incompatible schedules or are a hardcore car aficionado, that might be something you could ""afford"" rather than something you truly need/want.<p>Secondly I try not to own too much stuff, especially stuff I don't use. Owning stuff costs time and money, but we don't always see that because the costs are hidden and sprinkled around all over the place. If you're using your big house mostly to store a big bunch of stuff you've accumulated, you are paying your hard-earned money to heat your own personal junkyard. When you move house, you pay to move the junk. When the junk breaks you pay to fix it or to replace it -- because by keeping it you've already convinced yourself you ""need"" it, even if it's something you never/rarely use or whose function could easily be replaced by some other tool you have. So I try to purge the things I own regularly, keeping only the things I use and want. I did a big purge last summer and I'll probably do another one this spring. It can be hard, especially if you've been raised to believe that owning stuff is a good thing, or that ""you'll never know when you need it"", but it feels really good when you're done. This doesn't mean I live in a minimalist apartment with no stuff, of course. It just means I have a somewhat-smaller, carefully-curated collection of stuff -- stuff I'm consciously willing to actually heat and move and repair and replace.<p>Sorry if getting money advice from a poor college student seems insulting/silly. It probably is at least a bit silly, but it seems like you and I (and lots of others) have the same problem on different scales, so the things that help me might help you, if you want.",2092021,,,1

Current recs from the American Academy of Pediatrics is for both males and females to be immunized for HPV prior to initiation of sexual activity (1). Initially I do believe that the recommendation was only for girls but that has changed for two major reasons: increase herd immunity in the overall population and because men can also get malignancies and lesions from HPV. Of note, the vaccine does not prevent all HPV infections. The 4-valent vaccine covers the two most common cancer-causing HPV strains as well as two others that commonly cause warts.<p>As for whether a test like this would be useful in clinical practice, it would definitely depend on the situation. HPV is extremely prevalent ... by the time a person has been sexually active for a few years, it is almost guaranteed that they carry at least one strain of HPV (there are about 40-50 strains last I checked). However, most people never have any problems related to HPV, either because their immune system effectively suppresses the virus or because they have a strain that does not cause symptoms.<p>Is it useful for one to know that they carry a non-malignancy forming, non-lesion causing strain of HPV? Is it useful for 50% of the population to believe that they have an STI although it will likely never cause any clinical symptoms in themselves or any sexual partners?  I would say probably not. Is it useful to type the HPV strains of all infected patients? Maybe. Currently it would not be useful as we do not have effective antiviral therapies for HPV. However, understanding the epidemiology more clearly could certainly help as we decide which viruses to attempt to target therapeutically in the future.<p>I will say this: the test described in this article would generally be described as a &quot;fishing expedition&quot; in the lab where I did my graduate studies. These types of studies can be very useful in certain cases but I predict they may also cause a lot of confusion as we begin to find subclinical viral processes occurring in plenty of healthy people. As a society, we will have to change our perception of what it means to be &quot;infected&quot; with a virus and as a clinician, it may become more challenging to reassure patients that they are healthy (gut and skin microbiome data will likely create a similar predicament with regard to bacteria).<p>In any case, I&#x27;m sorry to hear about your difficulties with HPV.

And you are right that saying &quot;use HTTP&quot; is a bit hand-wavy.  XML is great at serializing <i>nouns</i> when you want to enforce the schema of those nouns.  It makes interop of nouns, verifying, quantifying, and some types of searches must faster and consistent.  XML was a reaction to widespread RPC and endless bit-order compat that wasted so many lines of code.  It comes from the same mindset as the people who made SQL -- &quot;conforming to schemas is good and what most people want.&quot;<p>However, in the last 10 years we&#x27;ve seen that it isn&#x27;t possible to conform to a single schema as requirements change, and that is why XML has generally lost favor to JSON.  This is a similar reason why NoSQL wins in many cases over SQL.<p>HTTP, in contrast to XML, is a set of <i>verbs</i> (called methods) and <i>identifiers</i> (typically urls), which is similar to what a file system is.  It leaves the <i>nouns</i> (the body in HTTP) to the application, but it does promote some properties (headers in HTTP) and have conventions for common properties (content-type).  The big difference between HTTP and most file systems is that HTTP is stateless, whereas many file operations are stateful (get a handle to a stream, write to a stream, close the stream).<p>HTTP would work as the API for a file system because it provides pretty good addresses for both local and remote and relatively low-level operations.<p>HTTP also has the benefit of being widely adopted, even during the Cairo development, which would have solved the chicken-and-the-egg problem from the first essay.<p>Using HTTP as a file system has key drawbacks: Applications would have to be re-written to use both the new APIs and new mindset of possibly high-latency operations.

In almost every case, applicants can&#x27;t win what they don&#x27;t put in the middle -- which means that they have to apply if they meet even some of the position requirements.<p>Unfortunately, for every well-qualified applicant there are many less-qualified applicants, and the deluge of applicants means that it&#x27;s simply not possible to review each person individually. Instead they get run through a filter built from loose heuristics that try to capture job requirements.<p>I&#x27;ve long felt that the solution here is the same as a busy nightclub: charge a cover.

It&#x27;s not about penalizing applicants, it&#x27;s about encouraging applicants to be honest about the fit between their skills and the position requirements. I predict there would certainly be fewer applicants failing FizzBuzz.<p>Employers are also hypersensitive to false positives (candidates who don&#x27;t work out), and a (justified) fear that they&#x27;ll invest in a candidate who will move on after learning and maturing in the company. It sucks having to fire someone who isn&#x27;t working out, and it can hurt morale even if the employee wasn&#x27;t producing. The cost of onboarding, training, and firing a candidate sets a high threshold against false positives.

The other popular framework is Revel which I think is &quot;too heavy&quot; and not my cup.<p>beego, revel are adaptation from other languages&#x2F;framework, beego is Python&#x2F;Tornado inspired and Revel is Scala&#x2F;Play inspired. beego is closer to idiomatic Go than revel, i&#x27;m not expert but feel their MVC based structure might not be &quot;congruent&quot; to Go&#x27;s interface&#x2F;composition construct. Sorry I can&#x27;t really explain what I meant, maybe Im just anti everything Rails like MVC for web framework.<p>Many Gophers prefer to use light libraries such as Gorilla to assemble their web apps, as Go already has basic http covered in standard library. Having said that it is good idea in Go land to have a recommended template&#x2F;structure based on these light libraries for a best-practice web app that covers standard web components that are outside of standard libraries such as session, context, user auth etc. This is to make it quick to assemble an web app with all essential, and a common code structure that makes maintenance easy -&gt; the advantages of a framework. Or maybe we do need to use a web &quot;framework&quot; for Go after all. Similar reasoning on why people are using Symphony&#x2F;Laravel for PHP now.<p>Go is highly recommended for coding server backend components, the processing and brain of app. But should one use Go for web front end? Go web libraries&#x2F;framework (beego&#x2F;revel included) is not as matured as Rails&#x2F;Django, so you do need alot more of your own coding for a complete web ui front. Let me break down:<p>* If you&#x27;re are more business oriented and would like your web app up as fast as possible, use Rails&#x2F;Django. I would still use Rails&#x2F;Django even if your web app is only Rest API for a Angular&#x2F;Ember app. You can then use Go to optimise your backend.<p>* If you would like to brush up your resume, by all means dip into Go for web app. As I predict it will help you 2&#x2F;3 years down the road. I just noticed that irc #go-nuts has more members than ruby&#x2F;rails. But then so is #haskell and yet Haskell is not as mainstream as PHP&#x2F;Python&#x2F;Ruby&#x2F;Java.<p>* If you are already Rails&#x2F;Django expert and am choosing between NodeJS and Go: keep on choosing as there is no clear advantage of one over the other. And you should also consider Clojure or even Scala. OK about Node vs Go for web app: NodeJS&#x2F;ExpressJS has has more than a year advantage thus you see more NodeJS&#x2F;ExpressJS projects. I think both are on par for time-to-market if you&#x27;re developing a REST API.<p>* If you are novice programmer and new to web app, learn something like Rails&#x2F;Django for web best practices. However because Go web library is close to metal, you will understand in greater detail on how web&#x2F;http actually works by coding a web app and reading Go standard http library. You might heard that Rails&#x2F;Django is passé and you might not want to waste time for something with &quot;no future&quot;. But don&#x27;t. Those are someone else opinion and Rails&#x2F;Django will be around for many years to come. In fact Rails&#x2F;Django is the top choice of many programmers who want to leave PHP&#x2F;Java web. It is quite difficult nowadays to be a one language programmer. So pick up as main one that is current mainstream web technology (PHP, Rails&#x2F;Ruby, Python&#x2F;Django) and bet on one for future that is not as mainstream (Go, Clojure, Scala). It is harder for new programmer to pick up newer tech as far as learning materials go.<p>* If you are a superstar programmer, yes you do need to pick up Go, in addition to Haskell, Clojure, Scala, Erlang, Fortran, Basic and ARM assembly.

(Welcome to fencing, where one's kit of electronics parts is almost as important as one's weapon. ;)<p>Now for anecdotes:<p>I fenced saber (<i>terribly</i>) back when saber wasn't electrified at the NCAA level - which is to say: there was no electric circuit to detect contact between Fencer A's saber and Fencer B's target area.<p>(Saber got electric scoring last, I suspect, because the head and arms are part of the target area and you need conductive gloves and masks, which cost money, particularly because it's harder to share gloves and masks between fencers than it is to share a simple mesh vest.)<p>Moreover, at a regular-season NCAA fencing match, there's no budget for <i>five</i> impartial judges per bout, and no spare unaffilated fencers sitting around. So the rule was that we had to make touch/no touch calls <i>in matches involving our own teammates</i>. This was, to say the least, a no-win situation for a beginner. I quickly learned to pretend I was half-blind and clueless – which, alas, did not require much acting talent – and round off all non-obvious calls in favor of my teammate. To do otherwise was to earn the undying enmity of one's own team.<p>The stress drove me crazy. In retrospect, I should have demanded to be switched to foil or epee – epee, in particular, with its electronic scoring and lack of right-of-way rules, was a gloriously straightforward sport; though I would still have been a lousy fencer at least I would have lost for clear reasons – but instead I fled after one season.<p>If there's a moral to this story, it's this: There is <i>no way</i> that this incident is the most unfair thing that has happened in the history of Olympic fencing. ;) They must have been really, <i>really</i> good sports back in the old days.",4339278,,,3

First of all, it doesn't even make much sense to talk about ""Lisp"" as if it's a language.  The difference between the toy lisp you can write an interpreter for in a page of code and Clojure is night and day.  And the other features are actually much more important than just being a Lisp.  I'd be afraid to work with the ""Haskell"" that the smug Lisper of the article slaps out with macros.  Not only would it probably not be as well designed as Haskell, unless they copied Haskell's hard work wholesale, but it wouldn't interop well with any other Lisp code.<p>Secondly, if you actually look at the defining feature of Lisp, S-Exprs and macros, it's not a good idea.  Code generating S-exprssions may be more sane than generating C code through string manipulation, but it's still a bad idea and for the same reasons.  Code is a human readable format (even if you force it to be S-expressions and pretend it isn't).  Code shouldn't be generating other code, it should be generating more structured values.  There are composability advantages to doing so and as an added benefit, you don't get stuck with S-expressions as syntax.  I predict that in the not too distant future, languages will provide a better alternative to almost every current use of macros (we're already over half way there).",2450973,,,6

It runs adequately fast, and has JVM threading, meaning that ceteris paribus it is 'fast enough' for the largely IO-bound tasks that make up web-programming. And when you program in JRuby you find yourself leaning on the Java libraries for most of the heavy-duty stuff (say what you like about Java, I certainly do, but the libraries are abundant and abundantly production-worthy). Ultimately, when you've got lambda and reasonably low-impedance hash tables then you can make everything else, so there's a future for Ruby.<p>Python on the other hand is a lost cause. Objects are a valid and important ingredient in a balanced diet of programming abstractions, but 'object-oriented programming' is for idiots or assholes or worse. Objects  as a first-class language feature are nice-but-optional, I've worked on large C systems written in an object oriented style (one was a simulation, another was a widget toolkit, both had 'object' as a meaningful native domain concept). First-class functions OTOH are not optional, without them you've designed a language for infants. If you are designing a modern high-level programming language and you choose to cripple lambda (either because you've made regrettable decisions about your syntax that prevents their expression, or because you want to put training-wheels on the language itself, or LOL both) then you're an asshole, full stop. Python's scoping is tragic, at least Larry and Brendan had the humility to admit they fucked up and add reasonable scoping. GVR isn't wrong, 30 years of hard-won experience with correct lexical scoping is. If you think Scheme is wrong then I've got news for you: you are. Funny, now that I think about it it's not even about right and wrong anymore, it's about 'Pythonicity', which basically means that not only is GVR never wrong, if you don't agree then you're some kind of barbaric programming-language outsider.

In my opinion, the biggest impediment to corporate R&#38;D is the modern emphasis on quarterly earnings and meeting third-party analysts' estimations thereof.<p>(Warning: idle speculation and arm-chair philosophy ahead)<p>When executive compensation is tied primarily to short term results, it seems inevitable that ""most"" companies will end up being run by those with the most talent and agressive behavior in this area.  Those people are usually bean counters.  Every company needs a bean counter, but only in the last (say) 25 years has it been the norm for every company to be LEAD by one.<p>It is that last point where I think the problem manifests the most.  There is, as everyone at HN knows, a difference between management and leadership.  Leadership requires vision, and no matter how visionary or innovative you are, if your ultimate goal is having a good day at this quarter's earnings call, it's hard to see how you could ever justify investment in something more than a few quarters off.<p>I'm greatly simplifying, of course.  I don't think this happens the way the naive view of this problem proposes: that productive, storied R&#38;D departments are summarily executed at the hands of a new CEO hellbent on meeting his numbers (well, I'm sure that DOES happen sometimes).  Rather, I think what has probably happened to most corporate research is this:<p>- The company is doing well, they're meeting their numbers every quarter and everything is peachy.  Much lip-service is paid to the R&#38;D team ""without whom none of our success would be possible"".<p>- Something happens.  Usually it's a bad economy or a disastrous product launch.  Maybe it's a huge corporate scandal.  Whatever it is, it's worse than just a few quarters of missed estimates.  The stockholders are screaming; the analysts and their puppy dog journalists are holding pitchforks.  The CEO promises that something will be done.  Decisive action will be taken to bring this mess under control.<p>- At first, the R&#38;D departments are spared, because no one wants to ""destroy the golden egg"" (or insert some predictable seed-and-flower metaphor).  But the first round of layoffs in middle management, manufacturing, and engineering aren't enough.  The stock price is still suffering.  Clearly more drastic action is necessary.<p>- But wait a minute, we hear in the boardroom, what about this thing they're doing in R&#38;D that's costing $30 million a year and probably won't produce anything marketable for 20 years, if at all?  I mean, R&#38;D is vital, but surely that stuff is better left to universities and foundations, right?  And just like that, the farthest-looking research project is cut.<p>- It's easy to see how things can proceed in this manner, with every downturn or crisis prompting a cut in the next most distant research project, until suddenly the R&#38;D department is  just the ""Two to Five Year D"" department.  At that point, they get renamed to ""Product Centers"", and are truly and officially subordinated to the management and politics of the quarterly earnings cycle.<p>I spend so much time laying this out because, just as these forward-looking places didn't disappear overnight by some nefarious CEO twisting his or her mustache, so can't they be made to magically reappear at existing corporations through some courageous magnanimous gesture of a new superhero CEO.<p>If you're the new CEO of Yahoo! (a pretty young company when talking about stuff like this), it's probably possible.  But ""Verizon Labs""?  ""P&#38;G Long Term Research""?  I don't think so.  In fact, I predict that even the storied Microsoft Research division will encounter this fate if the company's financial prospects continue to look south.<p>So what will resurrect the tradition of corporate R&#38;D?  I think several things:<p>1. Just as there is a trend toward online distributed learning, so I think will there emerge a trend toward online distributed research.  The Open Source movement is, in a way, the archetype for this (although it is closer to distributed engineering).  With new peer-to-peer open publishing and review systems (of which arXiv is a start), a lessened immediate emphasis on PhD credentials, a desire to mix and match areas of interest out of fun and curiosity, the continually shrinking barrier to entry (with everything from 3D printing to cheaper genomics), and the always-important promise of possible fortunes through startup spinoffs or ""acqui-hires"", it will become more and more common for fundamental research to happen outside the traditional places where it was done before.<p>2.  The larger, more expensive research will still be done at universities and companies, but the companies will be more of the Elon Musk variety.  In fact, I very much hope that he succeeds with Tesla and SolarCity as well as SpaceX, not only because I believe in those underlying visions, but because I think Wall Street and the rest of the world need to see ""altrusitic visionary capitalists"".  Skepticism and cynicism of capitalism in-the-large is at an all-time high, and it will take some larger-than-life personalities with spectacular successes to get those less courageous people and organizations to follow suit.  The ultimate end goal of this should be, among other things, ""the death of the quarterly analyst"" and, hopefully, a deepening of trust in the mechanisms of well-regulated capitalism supported (especially in the technical realms) by open and public-funded foundational research at universities and other institutions.<p>3. Long term, I really believe in the elimination of most physical scarcity.  If you can 3D-print a Ferrari, you might not care as much about stepping on so many toes to get one.  This is, I admit, a hopelessly naive and optimistic look at the future, and to some extent human beings will always compete with one another (it is, in my view, one of the things that make life worth living).  But in a world of post-physical scarcity, things like fundamental research and truly innovative product and service development may become THE things to brag about ""at the club"".<p>One can hope.",4328664,,,0

In the future, there'll be less $30 oil but we'll still have lots of $80 oil.   But that $80 oil will have the benefit of 50 years of technological advances to drive its price down.<p>2.

Thanks for the uservoice tickets (btw, uservoice is really awesome). This is great feedback thanks a lot.<p>* I&#x27;ll definitely provide more info on what happens after group play. We say in the rules that &quot;Predictions can be submitted at any time before the official start time of the concerned game&quot;, and this is true for all the games, including those in the knockouts. We thought that the knockout rounds would be extremely boring if your predictions are already set with the wrong teams. And you already got penalized for making the bad predictions in the group play. So we took the decision to open the knockout for predictions only when the teams are known, as it seemed to us that it would preserve the fun until very late in the competition.<p>* regarding the score inputs, actually I think this really depends on people. with my friends we wanted this level of details because it makes it more fun to us. To use your example, if I predict 4-0, you predict 4-1, and the actual score is 4-1, you will earn a few more points than me.",7874021,,,0

I would argue that Eliza has passed plenty of Turing tests, mostly with people who had a chance encounter with it.<p>But why would an AGI individual have to be able to lie about it&#x27;s childhood ? It could simply have a childhood. But I understand your argument : &quot;Human&quot; AI is constantly trained for the function &quot;be a human&quot;. Machine intelligence is being trained with &quot;is human X cheating&quot;, &quot;is this spam&quot;, &quot;what is the french for apple&quot;, &quot;which way will stock X go&quot; (and other &quot;what will &lt;large number of humans&gt; do in situation X&quot; questions) ... functions.<p>Keep in mind that your own brain is also simply running an algorithm, with &quot;hidden state&quot;. Here&#x27;s the first thing it hides pretty well : there&#x27;s no single &quot;you&quot;, there&#x27;s about 300 regions in your brain, that are physically different, in different locations, and not directly linked. And if the rest of your brain gets disabled, each of those 300 regions can use your body to convince your own mother it&#x27;s really you she&#x27;s talking to. And the function your brain is executing is not to &quot;have a soul&quot; or something like that, but is mostly a behaviour-copy algorithm. It searches out other humans, observes their actions, learns to predict them and then uses what it&#x27;s learned to &quot;be you&quot;. Most people will not believe this is how it works, not even when they know quite a bit about neurons, and know pretty well that this is what our neurons do.<p>But when it comes right down to it, you, me, everyone is an &quot;AI algorithm&quot; just like Google search. Aside from the shear scale, number of connections mostly, there is nothing all that remarkable about the hardware it&#x27;s running on.<p>I love how an AGI algorithm is presented in the follow up to the Battlestar Galactica series, &quot;Caprica&quot;. Zoe Graystone explains it at one point in the series. It&#x27;s fiction of course, but still. Her algorithm searches the internet, your computer, and everything and anything it can find for pictures and videos of it&#x27;s &quot;target&quot; and then builds the function &quot;given situation X, what would &lt;human&gt; do ?&quot; and then puts the algorithm in a virtual body that looks like the human, and uploads it to V-world. She runs it on herself, a friend and accidentally on a third person she doesn&#x27;t know and then proceeds to get herself blown up by a friend&#x2F;terrorist (they can be both at the same time, you know) in the first episode, and their avatars wake up in V-world, sort of a facebook virtual reality edition, unaware of what has happened (and as V-world is mostly used for sex, dancing and debauchery it&#x27;s not that easy to find out unless you&#x27;re looking for it). Currently we don&#x27;t have nearly enough data on any person to make this work ... but I am pretty convinced it is possible to make this work.<p>This would work, since it&#x27;s doing the same thing your brain does when it hears the question &quot;do you remember feeling happy when your mother held you when you were a baby ?&quot;. First, your brain doesn&#x27;t actually remember that either way. It simply works it&#x27;s way through to a good answer to that question. The thing it&#x27;ll do is predict how you should answer that question, given (mostly) how other humans answer that question.<p>This is a very different problem from &quot;lying about its childhood&quot;, specifically it&#x27;s much more solvable. Can I predict how humans would answer questions about their childhood ? Certainly. Easy. Make the algorithm take enough contextual information into account (so that it both realizes what realistic answers are and either answers realistically or responds in a way that humans respond when they don&#x27;t have a &quot;good prediction&quot; for an answer, for instance by saying they don&#x27;t remember, or by changing the subject, or ...)<p>If you have young kids you will see this process in action. You have to &quot;teach&quot; kids memory. When they talk only a little, if you ask them something about earlier that day, they will respond. And the response makes sense, but it&#x27;s not actually what happened. You will at some point realise this and correct them. Correcting them teaches them to match up what happened with their response, because they learn to predict that that&#x27;s what&#x27;s expected of people. Over time this correcting them will work, and they will have learned memory (and then they learn to lie, especially on questions like &quot;did you hit your sister ?&quot;, and when that ends badly they learn to &quot;not lie&quot;, like adults do. &quot;Did you hit your sister ?&quot; &quot;She stole my lego&quot;).<p>Note that the underlying memory is also a prediction. If I ask you what happened this morning, and you want to try to answer correctly, you will start with an obvious fact (which isn&#x27;t necessarily the truth), like &quot;I woke up&quot;. Your brain will take that thought, and predict (not remember) what happened next.

Repeat until generations have no clue any more about what the old ways were.<p>This is an absolute falsehood pushed upon society by those who wish to control the consumer base.  It is consumption destroying education, plain and simple.<p>The point is this: Every C64 that was ever produced - heck, every 8-bit computer, ever - <i>STILL WORKS</i>, or can be <i>MADE TO WORK</i> in the area of computer education.<p>It is absolutely arbitrary that computers get old.  Every machine that was ever made, is still just as useful as it ever was - the difference is, the user walked away (because they are consumers not users).<p>I have a large collection of &#x27;antique&#x27; computers in my midst: C64, Atari, Oric, Atmos, Telestrat, MSX, heck .. even a BeBox and an SGI O2.  All are still working, all are still quite capable of engaging a young mind in the exercise of exploration and discovery that makes a good developer.<p>And, my 3 year old and 6 year old kids LOVE THEM.  They absolutely LOVE the old sprites, the old simple ways.  The 6-year old takes immense joy out of typing:<p><pre><code>    10 PING
    20 WAIT 15
    30 EXPLODE
    40 WAIT 50
    50 GOTO 10

.. into an old Oric Atmos thats been set up exclusively for him to be able to do that .. in fact the very first writing he was able to do was in typing in a BASIC PROGRAM!!<p>The 3 year old absolutely loves that he can turn the machine off and on, and off and on, and off and on .. and it will still work.  Can&#x27;t do that with Daddy&#x27;s workstation!<p>So the point is, parents: disconnect your kids from the consumer trap.  Give them old computers to learn computing on.  Everything they will ever learn, <i>WILL STILL BE VALUABLE TODAY</i> when they &#x27;grow up and get a bigger computer&#x27; - the reason is, because computers still work, fundamentally, the same way.<p>I predict my 6 year old will be hacking in assembly by the time he is 10 - just like his Dad did.

But if the kids can&#x27;t do their own low-level programming by the time they get the rPi dusted off, I will be <i>very</i> surprised..)<p>EDIT: Another thing that is &#x27;wrong&#x27; with computers today, imho, is the decoupling of development from use.  Again, our computers have been turned into consumption platforms - the moment that Microsoft removed the developer tools from being part of the base OS image, computers started to lose a lot of value.

If I were Samsung&#x27;s CEO I&#x27;d put much stronger focus on making my own chips and putting them in my own devices (just like Apple), while <i>also</i> selling them to others, just like they sell their Super AMOLED displays and so on. I would also buy out AMD, mostly for their GPU expertise, but also to enter in the server&#x2F;data-center market, which is more profitable than the mobile market. Samsung has the money and marketing clout to do much bigger things than AMD can do right now alone.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the hell Nvidia is doing in mobile, but they always seem to screw something up. Their non-focus on energy efficiency in &quot;mobile&quot; and their focus on &quot;performance&quot; for umm..<i>tablets</i>, has proven to be a mistake <i>with every single chip generation</i>. Stop it, Nvidia! You need to win smartphones, not tablets, which are a dying breed already. And to do that you need low-end chips as well not just &quot;PC-class mobile chips&quot;, otherwise you&#x27;ll <i>never</i> get the market share you need to help you become &quot;popular&quot; in the mobile market.<p>And finally Intel - oh, Intel, how I despise thee. Two main reasons why I don&#x27;t want Intel to win even 5 percent of the mobile market. Short version: 1) they are anti-competitive, 2) they don&#x27;t deserve it.<p>Long version - Intel has started having quite the &quot;monopolist culture&quot; a while ago (at least a decade). They&#x27;ve learned that playing the monopolist card when in power &quot;works&quot; (to crush competitors and entrench themselves in the market), and they try to use it as often as they can and to the limit of the law (or even well beyond it, if no one is paying attention). Intel has almost wiped out GPU vendors from laptops through strongarming of OEMs and shady pricing tactics and, with Broadwell and Skylake having an even bigger focus on GPU performance, I predict within 2 years no one will even hear about an Nvidia GPU in an Intel-based laptop (unless we&#x27;re talking $2000+ machines - maybe).<p>They also have a monopoly in CPUs for PCs and are now using the profits they get there to sell their their Atom chips <i>below cost</i> (a practice that&#x27;s <i>illegal</i> in many countries, but either they aren&#x27;t paying attention or Intel manages to twist that into some kind of &quot;business deal&quot; they are making with OEMs).<p>That&#x27;s just the anticompetitive part. The &quot;don&#x27;t deserve it&quot; part comes from the fact that Atom sucks compared to the highest-end ARM chips, even though it&#x27;s built on 22nm FinFET, and those ARM chips are built on 28nm planar (if we&#x27;re to compare them at the time of market launch) - essentially a 3 year&#x2F;one node and a half process advantage for Intel. So they are trying to push bad products into the market and gain market share by selling them below cost to trick some OEMs into accepting their chips. And I say &quot;trick&quot; because that&#x27;s what it is - at best, a short term advantage of them, because if Intel would ever have even 20 percent of the mobile chip market, those same OEMs would have to pay them more than what they pay for ARM chips, because it&#x27;s &quot;Intel&quot;.<p>So many other shady Intel practices such as tricking consumers into thinking &quot;Celeron&quot; chips are Celeron, when in fact they are Atom, lying about the <i>real</i> TDP&#x2F;power values of their chips to make it seem like their PC chips are almost comparable to ARM (while being misleading about the fact that they also have much lower performance) and so on. Intel is a shady company through and through when it comes to selling its products.",8835080,,,1

Maybe it is because I am inexperienced in most of the topics he discusses in his essays but I am quite experienced in programming.<p>Some reactions to the essay:<p>""I predict a similar fate for Java""<p>It is ridiculous that pg once said he does not know Java at all. Yet he expresses his opinions about it. How can I take his opinion seriously as someone who knows almost the whole language specification of Java by head and had been programming in Java for at least 9 years? It is not only knowing the language which is important. But knowing all those problem patterns that have to be solved at typical enterprise projects. These projects are inherently complicated and has a lot to do with databases (and less with expressing nice and elegant algorithms). Java is not a particularly good language, but without developing a lot for in enterprise projects you really don't know what is needed by those projects. That said my favourite language is Scala. It ihas all the advantages of Java and the Java platform but it is a much better language than Java. It is not a 'pure' language. Pure languages never really do well for widespread practical use.<p>""I think it's important not just that the axioms be well chosen, but that there be few of them. Mathematicians have always felt this way about axioms-- the fewer, the better-- and I think they're onto something.""<p>First the core language in mathematics (the language of first order logic) is orthogonal to axioms. You can have a language with simple syntax (some math books define such a minimalistic language for first order logic), but it will not be good for practical use and will not be concise. So for practical use and for conciseness mathematicians have introduced plently of notations. (e.g. typographical conventions for differentiation, integration, infix syntax for addition, multiplication, etc...), etc. The real-world language that mathematicians use day-to-day is more like let's say Scala than a very pure language.<p>Axioms (and theorems derived from them) are more like libraries. There are plenty of axiom systems: (separate for numbers, geomerty, etc...) The whole mathematics is something like the Java ecosystem: lots of libraries.<p>What pg speaks about is some kind of utopia. A world where all programmers have to do is to express elegant algorithms. But programmers have to solve complex problems which mostly don't have an elegant solution at all. 100 years later we will still not have incredibly elegant solutions for our then hard problems. Even mathematicians don't always have elegant minimalistic solutions for their problems. Andrew Wiles worked for 10 years to prove his theorem. The proof is the result of lots of work and knowledge, and is incredibly complex. It does not fit on the margin at all.<p>Just look at natural languages: they are incredibly useful and concise in some sense, but they are incredibly complex. Programming languages will never be so complex, but they will not necessarily be extremely simple either.<p>Edit: I love minimalism, and I hate convoluted overcomplicated libraries and code bases, and I hate very leaky abstractions. The smaller the code base is the better: this is my main philosophy. But I still think that pg goes too far with his utopia for simplicity. I think that simplicity and conciseness of application code requires some complexity and intricacy on the core language and libraries side.",1833598,,,0

The biggest mobile platform of the moment is Android, and it's completely focussed on Java (whether that's a good thing is a whole different discussion).<p>Without Android, I think Java-the-language would fade very quickly, because IMO you can't possible assert the language is better in any way, for any kind of purpose, compared to the many alternatives. It's archaic, verbose, unnecessarily restrictive, misses most of the more modern language features, or bolted them on like ugly warts, it is not a very good RAD language because you need so much boilerplate, etc. In my experience (I've written about 100k lines of Java, many multiples of that in C, C++, Delphi, Python, Objective-C and PHP), Java is without doubt the least pleasant language to write.<p>As for Java-the-platform, I think that part of Java will not go away quickly. The JVM is actually very good, and the Java JDK frameworks are extensive, well-documented and well-known. New languages on top of the JVM, that allow leveraging the JDK frameworks will remain very popular for a long time, for good reasons.",4504504,,,0

A sales is a binary event, once it&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s done. Development on the other hand is (mostly) never complete. There&#x27;s maintainence to do, features to tweak, bugs to fix and so on.<p>Let&#x27;s consider a bug report. Let&#x27;s assume the client is not paying to get the bug fixed. Which developer then wants the job? Indeed since programmers are incentivized the same way as Sales, they need to &quot;complete&quot; lots of jobs quickly. The faster the better. Which leads to more corners being cut in the first place. Worse code, no-one interested in maintainence - these are not recipes for quality products.<p>One of the bigger problems with commission based salesman is they they&#x27;ll sell <i>anything</i> - limiting them to selling only what is already available takes strong management, and the occasional waving of a big stick. Our sales people work inside some tight constraints and are financially penalized when they oversell. This is a reaction to past sales people overselling, angering their commission, but for work which was ultimately unprofitable because they mis-sold the client the wrong product.<p>Culturally sales people are used to a commission -programmers are not. Sales people sell a lot of things that are eh to sell, and avoid products that are worthwhile, but hard to sell. If programmers were the same way we&#x27;d end up with mountains of 99c apps that do nothing as programmed searched for the killer app that takes no risks, but is easy to sell. Oh wait...<p>A single developer is ultimatlely paid on commission already - but he&#x27;s also motivated by the health of the business as a whole. The employee working on commission enjoys none of the long-term upside of the business, yet shares in all the short term downside. He&#x27;ll naturally want to work only on the &quot;hits&quot; and will quickly abandon projects if they&#x27;re not an inmmediate success.<p>We could also talk about co-operation (sales is notoriously insular, whereas programmers benefit from being sharing knowledge), the whole concept of &quot;after sales service&quot;, and so on, but I think you&#x27;ve got the point.<p>It&#x27;s good to ask this sort of question- but in this case I don&#x27;t see any benefit in paying them on commission, and I predict it would optimize developers in all the wrong sorts of ways, ultimately resulting in very bad code.",7250652,,,0

I predict that in the years to come many of them who want a second, bigger mobile device will prefer a device with a 11.6"" screen (like the small Macbook Air or one of the many Windows 8 tablets with an Atom or Intel Core processor) or a 13.3"" screen (like a lot of popular clamshells or the announced-but-not-yet-available Android-ARM-powered Toshiba Excite 13 tablet) over an Asus Transformer (with their 10.1"" screens) or an iPad (with their 9.7"" screens).",4733254,,,0

Parse includes significant automatic support for things like modeling users, comes with UI components for e.g. sign up, and includes e.g. a UITableViewController subclass to automatically support things like automatic paging.<p>2) While Parse's documentation is superb, these features come at the cost of flexibility (though you don't have to use all of them, of course -- it could just be a REST backend if you wanted it to be, like the heroku buildpack seen here). You'll tie your iOS app to Parse with PFObjects, whereas you're much more flexible with a backend agnostic approach that you'll get just using a REST web service.<p>3) The Heroku buildpack will probably tie better to CoreData. There might be a clean approach for this with Parse (when I used it I was pretty new to iOS) but I ended up having PFObject and Core Data representations of objects, which is rather clunky. Conversely, if you aren't using Core Data, this build pack wouldn't be helpful for you.<p>Some conclusions: 1) people who are learning to write iOS apps and don't have experience writing a web server should probably use Parse because it will be easier. It is my suspicion, as a few others have commented, that you will run into problems like ""Oh, how should I deal with user accounts and passwords"" that Parse will handle, but you'll have to figure out if using the buildpack. The buildpack comes with all the advantages you'd associate with Heroku -- other people know what those are better than me.<p>Let me also say that Mattt Thompson is an inspiration (check out his github and NSHipster.com, which are fantastic and foreshadowed this project) and I predict this buildpack will be as awesome as he can make it.",4805646,,,0

VFR traffic maintains separation by &quot;see and be seen&quot;. In other words, you look out the window for nearby traffic. Will drones have image recognition to detect nearby traffic?, I highly doubt it. Another way of separation is using the aircraft&#x27;s transponder. But this won&#x27;t necessarily work as not all aircraft have transponders. Many older GA aircraft do not even have an electrical system (other than the magneto spark plug system). A transponder is not required in class D, E, G airspace below 10,000 feet and 30 NM from a primary class B airport. The majority of the US is class E airspace.

But what you did, and what the coffee-drinking co-founder reportedly did (from EJ's perspective), make a very strong case for the importance of a competent PR person.<p>Quite simply, that competent PR person is the overseer of what has been said so far by the company, by the plaintiff, by the lawyers, and by the media. He or she, ideally, when queried by any of these parties, will answer such queries honestly with what he knows has been previously stated and/or promised by the other party, or will say ""I don't know that, let me ask [x,y,z] and I will get back to you.""<p>I understand how that's not a good enough decisive answer for anyone here, but that's the limits of human communication when dozens of stakeholders are involved. Some things are delayed because due diligence <i>requires</i> it...such is the complexity of life.<p>So who knows what really went on in the mind of the co-founder when he asked EJ to coffee. But according to her, we might assume that he himself assumed that EJ was properly comforted enough to send her a get-down-to-business email. She apparently was not. How could such a drastic misunderstanding happen when a co-founder, in your perfect world, is ostensibly the end-all point of proper decision and action?<p>To compound the problem, Brian Chesky writes the prototypical PR statement that looks downright shady in retrospect after EJ swiftly responds with a dramatic blog post that also accuses someone at airbnb of attempting to silence her blog.<p>Let's give Chesky the benefit of the doubt that he didn't know or condone such a request. Well, some well-intended white (from the investors' perspective) or black (from many other people's perspective) knight from airbnb apparently did so.<p>On top of all of that, EJ accuses airbnb of cold shouldering her until the blog blowup at HN. Hell, I don't remember the exact timeline, but I doubt even most of the avid participants in this thread do...certainly none of the newcomers won't bother sketching out a flowchart for themselves.<p>Boy, having one competent person be the sole point of contact -- even just a smooth-talking PR underling --  sure sounds good right now. Even if we give the co-founders the benefit of the doubt of being as upfront and willing to help as possible, the apparent innocent miscommunications have made many people, including MA, very jaded.<p>And now you've thrown yourself into the mix, in the belief that this is all caused by the immature incompetent behavior of the airbnb executive team (boy, that's a great message to future airbnb investors) and failed PR...don't you think it's a wee bit ironic to make your ""I-tracked-her-down-and-gave-her-info-to-PG-because-I-can't-see-PG-screwing-this-up"" comment in a HN thread based on a TechCrunch post in which a self-professed fan of airbnb accuses PG of outright lying?<p>If providing fodder for another top-voted HN thread that accuses airbnb of a coverup isn't a screw-up, then, well...<p>In any case, you might be a well-intentioned, smart developer and entrepreneur.

According to Alexa, Wikipedia is the sixth most visited web site in the world. But more to the point, no VC-funded or stock-market-funded company I know of is foolish enough to try to compete with Wikipedia.

In other words, I predict that Quora -- as well as Stack Exchange, which has also taken VC funding -- will be eclipsed within 15 years by sites not funded by VC or other profit-motivated investment.<p>Any competition for Google Search is likely to come from companies like Apple or Microsoft that already have plenty of money to pay engineers or from investor-funded for-profit companies. That is because the ""non-profit sector"" is unlikely to be able to summon up enough skilled labor or funding to compete with Google Search.<p>In contrast, setting up a competitor to Quora or Stack Exchange is relatively easy (especially since these new entrants can learn from Experts Exchange, Stack Exchange and Quora), and going the non-profit route (or the for-profit ""lifestyle business"" route without external funding) does not alienate a large fraction of potential unpaid contributors.",5221369,,,0

While the US claims &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; our legal system is structured opposite. The other, larger in my opinion, problem is that the focus has gone from using common sense to zero tolerance. This case is a prime example. I am not by any means support child pornography, but at the same time the sex offender laws in the US are out of control. Take for example a friend of mine who was drunk and got peeing in front of car on a dark street. A cop just happened to see him and he was subsequently arrested, charged, and convicted of indecent exposure. Because of the conviction he had to register as a sex offender. The US sex offender registry makes no distinction though between the individual caught peeing in the alley and the person who has molested hundreds of kids. The bigger issue is that no politician will touch correcting the situation for fear of being labeled as support child pornography. So while everyone knows the system is screwed up, and people continued to be punished harshly because of it, nothing will change because everyone is so scared to talk about the problem in the first place.<p>There are many other cases, outside of sex offenses, where individuals who may be guilty of a lesser crime take a plea deal to a larger crime to avoid the cost, time, and most importantly uncertainty associated with going to trial. I think, at least with sex offenses, we will see in the future a shift in dealing with the problem though. It is somewhat like drugs. In the early 1980s Reagan was hard-nosed on the war on drugs. He enacted stiff penalties and encouraged three strike laws. This sent a lot of people to jail for a long time on charges that were otherwise non-offenses. You see people in California serving life sentences for having three charges of possession of marijuana. Today though as a younger generation comes into power, and people are slowly changing their views on marijuana, we are seeing a shift in punishment for the same crimes. I predict that at some point there will be tipping point with crimes like this article highlight where people will say enough is enough we need to fix this problem.

I buy almost all of my computer equipment online, and yet I still find myself wandering through the Apple Store, just to experience the physical presence of computers and computer users.<p>Dedicated physical bookstores are going to get even harder to keep open. They might get smaller. They might continue to diversify until they're basically cafes with books lining the walls, or small performance spaces where authors gather to hold readings, or something. But I suspect that, somehow, the biggest and most successful publishers will continue producing copies of physical books and putting them on shelf displays in places where readers are likely to gather, just to get those books in front of people's eyes at the exact moment when those people are in a book-browsing mood.<p>Then they'll sell electronic copies.

Many pundits argued against its success on the basis that it couldn't replace any existing niche. While true, it created its own niche and replaced several devices for <i>some</i> of their functions.<p>But in no way did I predict the runaway success of the iPad.<p>After that became apparent I did make one prediction that I'll stand by: many clones will be announced, only a few of them will ship and they'll suck for at least the first year. Maybe two.<p>We're in year what? 9? of the iPod and yet the competition still isn't as slick. I see the same future for the iPad.

The 4""+ phones just seem a little too big;<p>3. 10"" for sharing: I don't really accept the premise. I view the iPad as a very personal (even intimate) computing device. Passing it back and forth isn't really what I'd call sharing. You can do that with anything you can pick up. Sharing I would view as two or more people looking at it at the same time;<p>4. 7"" for personal: disagree. Many people, myself include, love the size of the iPad. Eyesight comes into this as well, particularly for older users. 7"" to me fails the pocket test and (imho) the pocket test will be the differentiator in form factors.<p>Also regarding weight: on the couch it sits on your lap. When lying down you rest it on your chest. When at a desk or table it's on that surface. On a plane I rest my arm on the armrest or lap and hold the iPad. Basically I'm never holding it in the air.

Another common error: holding it by it's edge rather than your hand underneath in the center of gravity, which is much much easier.<p>5. No bigger: agree.<p>6. Battery life: agree. It seems Apple will be the king of battery life for some time to come.<p>7. Cameras: disagree. Cameras work for PCs and notebooks because the position (at the top of the screen, typically) is eye level. In none of the aforementioned positions would a front facing camera be at a natural or flattering position. I'm not saying cameras won't be added but I don't think the use case is as compelling as some make out.<p>Basically, who wants to look up someone's nostrils?<p>As for rear cameras, the weight issue once again comes into play.

Frankly, I found the argument that the iPad is purely a consumption device to be condescending, even pretentious. I do agree that you won't see any serious programming done on tablets. You need a keyboard, mouse and large display for that.<p>9. Aspect ratio: I can't see these things going to 16:10 or 16:9.

CEO Tim Cook focuses too much on preserving revenues streams, rather than disrupt them as predecessor Steve Jobs risked so many times.</i><p>Stuff like this makes me think this guy is a jackass. Steve Jobs never &quot;disrupted an established revenue stream&quot; - in 1999 he started with nothing, and built everything from scratch. He died with the company in full throttle, and that&#x27;s that. Never had the need or the chance to do what this author is suggesting.<p>Furthermore, how exactly can you fault Apple&#x2F;Cook&#x27;s performance post-2011? Their releases have all been solid improvements which have sold like hotcakes. Their products still command global consumer consciousness like no other brand. The iPhone and iPad stand as the centre of gravity of the mobile market, and the confusion and noise of the myriad products churned out by Apple&#x27;s ertswhile competition only further cements their stature. Other than a few small exceptions (screen size in particular), they still control the focus of consumer desire - the average consumer only knows and cares about a particular feature once Apple has pointed to it. Watch what happens post-5s - if other phone manufacturers release a spree of devices with novel unlocking mechanisms, you can guess why.<p>Everything Apple has done has been profitable and popular. They&#x27;re playing from a position of incredible strength, so why should they rush out and reinvent the wheel? They have time, their current position is stable, and it would only advantage competitors to reveal their next plans before Apple is ready or it is even necessary to do so.<p>I think the mistake people make here is in confusing what happened to Microsoft with what might hypothetically happen to Apple. But Apple isn&#x27;t Microsoft. There&#x27;s no indication whatsoever that Apple is taking their current strength for granted - moves like the new campus suggest a firm focus on and faith in a very long-term future. The only people who are dissatisfied with Apple&#x27;s performance are impatient, ignorant tech commentators, who seem to depend for their sense of self-worth on a deluge of new gadgets to critique. It&#x27;s a serious cognitive failure to imagine that just because Apple overturned incumbents, Apple must be equally vulnerable to being overturned, as if the marketplace just cycles through the same rough dynamic with little to no variation. Apple blew the competition out of the water because it was better, and in so doing it set a new bar for product and ecosystem execution that until now no other device manufacturer could equal - a bar which it has only maintained and even raised.<p>We&#x27;re only now starting to see the market rebalance with Google and Amazon emerging as real competitors, with Microsoft a big question mark about when and if they will ever rise to the occasion. But the ball is thoroughly in the competition&#x27;s court, so right now Apple can watch, analyse, and plot its next move.

My prediction is this...<p>1) Closed incubators such as this one and other clones will be displaced by a highly scaleable open free solution that offers a solution where 1% are not needed.
2) Closed crowdfunding funding platforms like profounder, KS, IGG, etc will be disrupted by our free version that offers TWO new ways to raise funds, 1) has raised over $1.6bn  for npo strategic initiatives and another is my creation that I call passive crowdfunding.
3) Developers will be marginalized to becoming construction workers.

We are a blue ocean strategy just letting now the red ocean we are here and would LOVE you to own some of use to hedge against our disrupting your business model. Jimmy Wales never did that...

I would guess it's going to struggle as a free site (since it doesn't have any ads) and will also struggle as a paid site because it's not sufficiently niche and its funding expectations may preclude the types of revenues it could viably make.

My friends and I had not yet found a suitable World Cup prediction competition site.<p>I immediately signed up, and was ready to send off some invites, when I found that Scoragora wanted me to predict a score for each of the 48 matches in group play, a fairly tedious exercise. Further, upon completion, it is completely unclear whether the game will be calculating winners and runners-up from the groups automatically, whether there will be an opportunity to pick winners in the knockout rounds—basically everything after group play is a mystery.<p>Suffice to say this is not what I expected. I can understand some need for score predictions—most likely in the later rounds for tie-breaking purposes (perhaps the best way to handle this is to ask users to predict the cumulative goal differential of the winning side). But score predictions ultimately aren&#x27;t the core functionality of a game like this. If I predict that Brazil will defeat Mexico 4-0, and my friend predicts that Brazil will win 4-1, I don&#x27;t really care who was right about the score, we both rightly acknowledged that Mexico is a shambles at the moment (poor Chicharito—he&#x27;s only 26!) and that Brazil ought to win.<p>The functionality I expect to see front-and-center is, simply put, predictions about who wins each match through the final. I truly can&#x27;t tell whether that functionality exists in Scoragora right now, and I don&#x27;t really care to predict 96 scores for the privilege of finding out. Moreover, I&#x27;m the geek in my group of friends, there&#x27;s at least some chance I might fill out the entire prediction form to satiate my curiosity about how you&#x27;ve constructed this web app, but I&#x27;m certain none of my friends will have the patience to do so, so I won&#x27;t be inviting them, and we&#x27;ll conduct our competition elsewhere.<p>UPDATE: I&#x27;ve just tried out Yahoo&#x27;s game, and theirs is structured almost identically (though a bit prettier), so maybe my expectations are out of line? I don&#x27;t understand why the game basically resets when the knockout rounds begin.

It doesn't seem as unique as it once was and many of the topics that make it to the front page seem to be more formulaic.  Furthermore many newcomers seem to post the same things that were raised here previously.  I've lost track of the number of topics about hosting providers, credit card processing and the like.  Also with the increased volume it's been hard to make effective use of the ""new"" page.

Not true, but I think that&#x27;s largely because much of the software used is closed so the FOSS community is largely anemic in the bio world. For the tools that are FOSS or BSD, I saw plenty of contributions, but the other thing to keep in mind is that it&#x27;s not just about the programming. You have to have a certain level of understanding of the application domain to program a solution for it properly, and there are very few of these people around. I predict a huge uptick in demand and salaries for bioprogrammers.<p>2. Is true. You need your own people on salary to program for your needs. I was the sysadmin part of a phd, sysadmin, programmer team and we were doing stuff that no-one else was going to do for us. You need to have your own programmer, and a good sysadmin, full stop.<p>3. Is also true. Picking the right license is important because many labs are pretty tight on cash flow. Sure, they probably have millions going through them a month, but operating costs are super high and margins are lower than you may think. It was during my time in the genetics lab that I fully realized why FOSS was so important, and I think it&#x27;s the future. (with a few key proprietary exceptions that no FOSS has matched yet, (think Elmer vs Comsol))<p>4. Using a FOSS license makes this a moot point to address. Use GPLv3 code people, stop using BSD!<p>5-9: not worth addressing.<p>Anyway, my overall view of the field is this: with sequencing getting cheaper, the problem is in managing the levels of data being generated (sysadmin issue) and in interpreting the data for meaningful results (programmer&#x2F;phd issue). Personally, I think that machine learning is going to be the right breakthrough to follow and apply to bio, and once we do that I expect it to take off to crazy levels. I&#x27;m talking sequencer in every doctors office, and artificial genetic manipulation becoming much easier and with more accurate predictions.<p>Also, the other thing everyone underestimates is the microbiome as an entity. You are more the bacteria that lives in you than you are you. Of course, I struggle to understand the science sometimes, I&#x27;m just a sysadmin, so take what I say with a grain of salt.",9863721,,,8

These clinics tend to be both more available (longer appointments, weekend appointments) and more flexible (phone, chat, email communications w/ the doctor).

The gold standard within the legal profession we are constantly led to believe is to pursue a standard of objective fairness and justice which would be better defined by deterministic, logical languages like programming languages rather than fuzzy, broad languages like English.<p>It is far, far easier to have laws written in code and execute test cases based on those laws before even investing any capital into a venture which may require edge cases of a given law, rather than the current scenario of hemming and hawing around a fundamentally subjective and fuzzy area and eventually subjecting your endeavour to the rigors of being a legal ""test case"" consisting of much ado about nothing and the outcome is as close to random as anything else.<p>When you reduce the legal profession to coding and writing test cases though, hell will freeze over the next day. Such a politically powerful faction will <i>never</i> allow themselves to be marginalised in this way, even if they claim to desperately be striving for exactly the kind of scenarios that this would allow; universal access to a completely objective justice system with etc etc etc. The extent to which this is actually impossible is somewhat depressing because it's something of an expose on the hypocrisy implicit in the claims of the legal system to actually serve the public, rather than itself.<p>But hey, that's life. If it ever <i>does</i> happen my wager is it will be because it is forced on them through market forces, the public at large simply uses alternatives venues for mediation and the legal system is forced to compete with it.

Since then, the principles of &quot;proportionality&quot; and &quot;evolving standards of decency&quot; are evolving to ascertain constitutionality questions. Neither principle appears to do the trick.<p>Of the four principles above, only the first seems to apply. So the Court will have to declare that solitary confinement is torture in order to stop its widespread use. As seen, the Court has historically been cautious in declaring punishments unconstitutional, waiting until the battle has already been mostly fought in the sphere of public opinion.<p>Given the stances the Court has taken concerning the death penalty, I predict that no sweeping, immediate prohibitions will take place, rather the Court will apply largely ineffectual provisions to the imposition of solitary confinement.<p>For example, the Court has ruled in 2002 that capital punishment is constitutionally cruel and unusual when applied to inmates with intellectual disabilities.

Banks stopped lending to consumers as readily as they had before the crisis while the Federal reserve kept interest rates and especially interest rates they give to banks extremely low.<p>This meant that if you already had capital(large businesses, wealthy individuals) it was easy to get nearly free money. whereas if you didn&#x27;t it was nearly impossible.

The Fed has injected large amounts of cash into the asset markets using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quantitative_easing</a> .  I&#x27;ve never added up the cash as a percentage of GDP or one of the Ms, but it always seemed significant (i.e. 5-10% of GDP, but this is debatable).  I should caveat by saying that this cash never entered general circulation, which has meant treating it as part of the monetary supply is tricky.<p>Now, based on this fact of Fed intervention there are a few opinions:<p>1. While the Fed directly isn&#x27;t buying equities (i.e. stocks, but this is as far as we know), its presence means that all the other cash holders have to seek out other investments to get inflation-beating rates of returns.  There isn&#x27;t hard data to support this, but it is the conventional wisdom of both people in the game and macro economists.<p>2. The magnitude of the impact on the asset markets is up for debate.  I&#x27;ve seen numbers as low as -5% and has high as 60% of last year&#x27;s stock market returns can be attributed to the Fed intervention.  Some of the difficulty is that there was large federal fiscal stimulus impacting during this time, and counter-intuitively there is some argument that the Fed neutralized the fiscal stimulus to hold inflation rates constant.  The important part is that there was a stock market surge, and it is not a result of retail investors pouring in money: It is a result of institutions balancing away from bonds to stocks (this is what the GP means by &quot;supply-side&quot;).  It&#x27;s just not clear if the institutions did it because they have confidence in the economy or if they were &quot;forced&quot; by the Fed.  The &quot;why&quot; is opinion, and many people believe the fed is the &quot;why.&quot;<p>3. On the micro side, seeing 20-something kids get 150k budgets to screw around for a year is maddening.  &quot;It&#x27;s ok, VCs play the numbers game... we just need one tulip to pay 100x.&quot;  There is too much money chasing &quot;talent&quot; right now, and should the correction to the asset market happen this year (as I predict from the fed&#x27;s cessation) then we will see the startup bubble unwind.",7008361,,,0

They're not necessarily competitive options vis-a-vis a single company, but if you offered terms like that, I predict no savvy person taking you up on them.<p>A more viable approach to generating cash early in the life of a company is to pre-sell a particular product which is either time-bounded or feature-bounded in return for a largish sum of cash paid up-front.  For example, Joyent used to be a fairly attractive option for Rails hosting, and they had a shared server offering where you could buy a lifetime membership on a particular tier for a few hundred dollars.  Selling ~6 of those memberships buys you the physical machine to host many more than 6 of them, meaning they raised enough capital to buy machines (or demonstrate creditworthiness to Dell) to have available inventory for more traditional hosting plans.<p>Slicehost similarly had a massive cash flow crunch at one point which was preventing them from buying hardware to service new customers for their VPS offering, back when VPSes were quite new and Slicehost was heads-and-tails the best game around.  They had an amusing auction-like mechanic: they sorted their waitlist by the dollar value you were willing to pre-pay, so if (for example) you wanted the $20 a month VPS but were willing to pre-pay for the first 6 months, you got in earlier than someone willing to prepay 3 months or desiring month-to-month.  This essentially let Slicehost borrow e.g. Bingo Card Creator's credit cards to buy new servers from Dell, without ever needing to offer any sort of equity or do anything very tricky with accounting.  (Book $1,000 of cash as assets and $1,000 of unearned revenue as liabilities, spend $1,000 cash from assets and add $1,000 of servers to assets, gradually debit unearned revenue as I consume services every month.)<p>Another example is Spreedly, which sold a particular plan for their SaaS service (I think they called them ""Kickstarters"", actually?) where you'd essentially pre-pay for 2 years of service and in return get service for life.  It apparently worked out pretty well, though your accountant will hate you if you do that.  A more typical example is a SaaS company offering you 10% off the monthly rate if you sign up for yearly billing and 15% off if you sign up for bi-yearly billing, which in both cases will tend to have the SaaS company get a whole bunch of cash upfront.  (And the same accounting thing as Slicehost, above.)",4294604,,,0

And since users would also be fighting Kivy&#x27;s UI bugs, I predict every user would immediately ragequit my app.  (E.g. drag-selecting text within multiline textboxes seems to be broken, etc.)<p>That said, Kivy is very close to being an effective way to effortlessly write crossplatform GUI apps.  The main reason to use Kivy is because it&#x27;s so easy to write useful apps with it.  I wrote one in about 15 minutes from start to finish.  The API is a pleasure to use, and the data binding design is especially brilliant.<p>Kivy seems pretty fantastic for writing internal tools. Data visualization via Python is now a cinch thanks to Kivy.  For example, it&#x27;d be easy to write an app that shows the current status of all your server instances.  And of course at that point it&#x27;d be easy to extend your app&#x27;s functionality with features like &quot;right click on a server instance to spawn an SSH session into it&quot;.  Stuff like that is a breeze thanks to Kivy.<p>Time to try out everyone else&#x27;s suggestions.  Up next: Clojure + Seesaw. (This thread has been incredibly helpful...  So many interesting ideas.

Not sure if it will be a shooting war -- but these things usually turn out that way.<p>Are we morally obligated to obey unjust laws? Woof. That's a can of worms.

I think it's reasonable to say two things here. 1) Jefferson's time was simpler, with tremendously fewer laws, and 2) disobedience that may involve the death of someone is of a different nature than that which may not. (see earlier comment)<p>MLK begins with this more complex world and addresses your question -- unjust laws. Key quote here: <i>One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty.</i><p>Both are great examples of great men thinking through difficult problems. I side with Jefferson a bit more than MLK, simply because I think you can moralize yourself into a snit over just about anything. But MLK is saying that even if you're right, there's no free pass: you still owe the larger society something.<p>As to your final point, I should have been clearer. I have no problem at all with war in all its messiness being displayed all over the place. This is the way it should be. What I object to is the selective use of images -- coffins coming off planes, no information for months and then a dump of collateral damage videos -- any one of a dozen ""dirty tricks"" that involve manipulating the viewer.<p>During the American Civil War, we had photography for the first time. There were some god-awful battlefield images shown to the public. But oddly enough, nothing much happened. People are very capable of understanding the brutality of war. I don't think it's much of a secret.<p>I'm very conflicted on Afghanistan. From the half-dozen COIN books I've read, we're going to have to make peace with the Taliban. But Karzai is something of a cross between a rabid badger and a skunk -- he's selling us out as we speak.<p>I don't have an opinion right now, frankly. I supported Iraq and Afghanistan because I honestly felt that in the 10-20 year time period, less lives would be lost by taking action.  I also felt from a personal perspective that it was better to give nation-building a shot rather than carpet-bombing from afar. I still feel that was a good call.<p>But I feel that strategically, in Afghanistan at least, the scales are tipping. The military we have -- few boots with lots of cool high tech and a tendency towards kinetic fighting -- simply doesn't match the terrain or battle in Afghanistan, no matter how hard we try to patch it up.<p>I think the average citizen, especially when it comes to fighting, should read. A lot. I understand what Karzai is doing and why. I understand what we're doing. I understand why civilians get killed. Wikileaks is just data. Data presented for the shock of impact.

It's not the same.<p>What I do think, is that there's a huge moral dilemma when we in the western world who're enjoying the fruits of economic growth are now ready to push much poorer parts of the world into slowing their growth, and thus slowing their ascent to the prosperity we're all but taking for granted.<p>&#62; Why this spurious equation of energy efficiency with a halt to economic development?<p>Energy efficiency is going to advance itself, since efficiency equals money saved. But the kind of energy efficiency sought under the banner of saving the planet has nothing to do with efficiency, and everything to do with forcing us into using less energy at whatever the cost.<p>&#62; Your argument implies that economic development in poor countries must follow the same path that of the west during the industrial revolution<p>Burning fossil fuels is <i>by far</i> the cheapest and easiest way to generate mechanical and electrical energy on demand. Especially when bootstrapping an infrastructure, it's also the most efficient. Gasoline, diesel and oil are simply the only readily available sources of energy that's immediately and cheaply transportable and storable. There is no reason to believe that rural Africa is going to go anywhere without burning a lot of fossils. China and India are sufficiently densely populated and able in terms of infrastructure that they can probably fuel much of their growth electrically -- but barring a breakthrough in nuclear power, there's only so much of it that's going to be generated without fossil-burning.<p>However: That might change, come economic development.<p>Taxing (in whatever way, directly or indirectly) carbon emissions -- and that's really the only political proposal that's on the table will curtail economic growth: It will make it harder for the ""little man"" in China, India, Africa and Russia who can create economic growth by driving his car to the next town, or who can increase yield from his field by using a tractor, or mechanised irrigation pumps, or who tries to run a factory. To hundreds of millions of people there is simply no way of doing these things available, that doesn't involve burning fossils.<p>Since rich countries for this reason will be expected to lead the way, it will also mean that the inventor of something that might change this dynamic, would have a harder time raising the necessary capital. The richer an economic is, the more money it can afford to throw into universities, research and startups.<p>&#62; I've been following (but not crusading for) environmental issues for 20 years<p>Good. Then I'm sure you'll agree it would have been disastrous if humankind had sat down in 1989 and decided to implement a world-wide scheme that would essentially dampen economic growth and development.<p>&#62; We have greatly enhanced our technology over the last 20 years, so why can we not put that expertise to work now, instead of waiting for some future panacea?<p>Because we still don't have a solution that doesn't involve dragging down the world economy. Our solution today is to try to stop doing the things that emit carbon, but as long as those things are also to a large extend the things that create wealth, it has some extremely bad side effects. Wind turbines are fine for up to about 15% of the electrical supply in the developed world. Solar is promising where and when the sun shines. Water plants are fine where are water for them (not many places left, if any). Nuclear is nice, except for the waste and the extremely high requirements for safety (making them slow and expensive to construct and operate).<p>We are getting there, and we have several outs. Electrical cars and hydrogen infrastructure would allow a much higher share of wind and solar in the mix. 3rd gen. biodiesel might help. Efficient scrubbers would allow us to stop caring about coal, oil and gas plants. But we are not there yet.<p>&#62; As for being in better future financial shape, you assume an inevitable upward trend (...) Only a few short years ago the bull market was hailed as a great economic success<p>Energy creates wealth, because it makes the same person more efficient. That's the essence of the industrial revolution: harnessing energy in machines, suddenly one person can create much more. Since then, machines and how we operate them has developed massively in favour of efficiency -- from the steam hammer to Tim Ferris operating business on an iPhone lying on a beach.<p>And we need to look at the economy at a much grander scale than 10 years. Economies expand and contracts, but over a longer time, it invariably expands. When there is talk of global climate change, a scale of 100 years is more appropriate.<p>&#62; To believe that some future market will be so awash in capital as to render environmental improvement a trivial overhead is to subscribe to a form of socioeconomic teleology<p>I'm not claiming that. I'm claiming that it's going to be richer than this one, and not least, more developed than this one. About 120 years ago we worried about the wether the supply of whale oil could meet the demand -- in other words, it seemed unlikely that in the future, the market would be awash (pardon the pun) in whale oil. Then we refined mineral oil, and that was that. Nobody knows what the future holds. The officials going to Copenhagen (which reminds me, I need to find a place out of the city to park my car for those weeks) think they know what the future holds.

I know it's basic psychology, but it still amazes me that tons of people using a $200 phone that costs on the order of $80/mo to use bitch endlessly in reviews and negatively rate apps for charging the ginormous price of $3.  Or something equally out of line.  This is exacerbated by shitty discovery in the app store.  There's massive returns to being on the top app in category X list, and that's very difficult to do at higher prices.  Plus you can't create paid upgrades without creating a new product in the app store, forcing you to start from zero with marketing and list rank.  I predict the mac app store will likewise exert downward price pressure on app prices.<p>Sparrow is really really cheap.  A generation ago I used eudora, which cost $50 to $100, for email.  So between the mid to late 90s and 2012, the price fell something like 80 to 90 percent to $10 for the mac program.  The above is worsened by the rise of decent free email clients since it diminishes the audience.<p>If you do the math, you have to sell a fuckton of $2.10 cent apps to afford salaries for good developers: say four people at $200k/year fully loaded (salary, health insurance, ss, medicare, office space, internet, diet coke, coffee, macbooks).  That's 380k sales just to tread water.  And we didn't deduct marketing expenses which are probably significant: you'll have someone fulltime doing seo / sem / banging on blogs and reviewers to get organic / etc.  Plus, again, Apple has created a norm where apps get updated forever for free.  So that $2.10 is close to being a <i>lifetime</i> value for a user.  That means you probably can't use sem for user acquisition: a <i>wildly</i> optimistic 10 percent clickthrough <i>and purchase</i> rate (an order of magnitude high for most things) and 20 cents per click (also wildly cheap) puts you at $2.00.<p>I presume Apple does this because of classic economics: increase demand by decreasing the price of complements.  But if developers can't get paid, users can't have nice things.  And I'm not an ios or mac dev, but looking at the interactions in their apps, they seem super custom.

Suppose record #123456 in a database contains a syntax error (I can list dozens I found, like a copyright date of 19995 breaking my four-digit definition, or SWISS-PROT record with the copyright lines in the wrong spot.) How do I have the parser ignore that record, report the problem, and continue parsing with the next record?<p>Error recovery in context free grammars is hard, but doable.<p>Then how do I say that &quot;if the ID is XYZ and the version number is 12 then use this work-around because that release had a bug which has since been fixed&quot;? In practice and unlike a computer language, the format spec ends up being less important than the actual data, so you end up with lots of tweaks to handle vendor errors.<p>P.S.: Wouldn&#x27;t<p><pre><code>    names = [SQLiteMagician.types.get( type( d ).__name__) for d in data[0]]
    types = [&quot;NONE&quot; if t == &quot;NoneType&quot; else t for t in names]
</code></pre>
have been less crazy, and to be preferred? Also, and I&#x27;m not sure what that code is trying to do, but sys._getframe() and linecache from the standard library should help, as might this example, which I think does what you want without using the ast module:<p><pre><code>  import sys

  def show_me():
      caller = sys._getframe(1)
      f_code = caller.f_code
      names = f_code.co_varnames[:f_code.co_argcount]
      local_vars = caller.f_locals
      for i, name in enumerate(names):
          print repr(name), &quot;=&quot;, repr(local_vars[name])
    
  def spam(x, y, z=4):
      a = &quot;%s %s %s&quot; % (x, y, z)
      show_me()
  
  spam(&quot;Hello&quot;, 2)
</code></pre>
This gives as output:<p><pre><code>  &#x27;x&#x27; = &#x27;Hello&#x27;

Let's not worry too much about that because by the time we get closer to doing something it will be a lot clearer what works or not.<p>But when you bring up something like education, where we already have many private educational institutions, and public schools are widely regarded as largely failing, no I don't think the Government is good at this and no I don't want to spend billions in taxes on throwing money at stuff with <i>institutional</i> problems other than underfunding (e.g. teacher's unions and <i>the wrong epistemology</i>).<p>A good transitional proposal is vouchers.

Therefore your $10k will become $14,262 after fees, which you can then wire back to your bank account.  $4k is a pretty nice chunk of change, so you may want to seriously consider it.<p>But you must be willing to keep your money in BTC if the price tanks.  It requires a lot of discipline not to freak out and sell.  The overall thing to remember is that BTC will almost certainly hit $1500; it&#x27;s just a matter of when.  So if you have a mutual fund, you may want to redeem it buy BTC instead.<p>Something else to consider:  the price of BTC won&#x27;t be able to double very many more times.

This is a weakness, not a drawback. It can certainly be fixed without undermining the iPad's value proposition. If somebody starts selling a lot of tablets that sync to the cloud, Apple can release a firmware or iOS update that syncs to the cloud and boom, no more weakness.<p>It's annoying but it isn't deeply tied to the iPad's value proposition. So I predict that if and when Apple thinks it is more of a hinderance than a help, it will be changed, and the change will be fairly painless.",2292081,,,0

Well, guess what, they just can't do that. For starters because their users would get very angry when their torrents stop working, and would jump ship for any other ISP that announces that it either doesn't do NAT or has implemented IPv6.<p>There is still a huge amount of work that can be done to compress the usage of v4 address space. Maybe not much that the RIRs or the ISPs can do, but as the cost of owning a static IPv4 address goes up (and I believe that it will go _way_ up), end users will start compressing their public services into fewer addresses and giving back small subnets to their providers to reduce costs. I mean, who the hell needs to have a mail server and a web server in two different public addresses when they can just do port-forwarding over a single address? (And since most servers are on DMZs with private addressing, they are mostly doing it already, it's just a matter of renumbering.)<p>The case most likely to go NAT is also the most likely to go IPv6: mobile devices. These are mostly behind NAT already, and going IPv6 would actually reduce costs for ISPs. It would also put ISPs in the track for more extensive IPv6, since the major problem now is that people have little knowledge of how IPv6 works and ISPs are trying to avoid the pain. The issue is, of course, that 99.9% of mobile devices don't support dual-stack and even in a pure v6 configuration don't actually work properly.<p>For this I predict that in 10 years the move to IPv6 will still be half-way.

Patents, unlike Copyrights, are not 'renewable' in the sense that once their 20 year term expires they revert to the public domain by law. Further, now that folks have successfully litigated bogus Patent Marking [2] you can't use an old Patent number on your design to intimidate folks into not copying it.<p>So while filing rates continue to be high (although as you see from the linked graph issue rates have been falling) the patent office has become better educated about what should be and what shouldn't be patentable (not perfect yet but its getting noticeably better, if only because patent examiners are entering the market who grew up in a digital age).<p>So a side effect is that when the patent claims for issued patents expire, that's it, no more revenue. You can perfectly legally implement the RSA key exchange algorithm now (as an example) without infringing on any patents. This was speculated to be the primary reason that RSA Data Security Inc was trying to get people signed up to use their <i>Copyrighted</i> implementation of same, since if you licensed the copyrighted code, and then decided to stop paying them license fees and implement it yourself they couldn't sue you for patent infringement but they would want to go through your code to see that you hadn't used large parts of their software in your new design. That approach was unavailable if you hadn't been given access to their source code.<p>So starting in 2010, and accelerating until 2020 <i>all</i> of those patents that were issued between 1990 and 2000 will revert to being public domain.

Just slow down and move off to the side of the road. But when is it OK to move off to the side -- what if there is something in the way, what if a pedestrian didn&#x27;t expect you to move there, what if the car behind you suddenly gets in the way while it&#x27;s pulling over, what if you&#x27;re on a bridge, what if the ambulance behind you turned already and no one expects your car to suddenly pull over?

The US, as the only superpower (financial, cultural, and military) is not just one country among many.  What happens in the US affects every corner of the planet.  I am living right now in Indonesia and I see that every day.  There are other countries which this can be said for, but they all are oil exporters and their impact is solely a function of those oil exports.<p>At the same time, I find a lot of Americans seem to think the other countries don't matter as much as they do.  Consequently we have these bizarre discussions of how anti-American one country or another is, and, absent them calling America the great Satan or the like, one wonders how much of it is being intolerant of a level of dissent in foreign countries that would be perfectly allowed at home.<p>So the truth is very often more complicated than simple dichotomies.<p>The exception is that I would agree with #4.  The US has a number of huge looming challenges which affect our country in a way no other country is affected.  These include what I call ""peak oil"" (see below, not quite what peak oil theorists mean), the baby boomer retirement (this affects us differently than China or Japan, but Europe is going to feel the effects too), and a need to repair/replace much of our existing infrastructure.  The infrastructure disrepair is becoming evident now, but I want to spend more time on the others.<p>Peak oil is usually defined as an absolute peak in production, after which production cannot rise to the same level.  This is not what I mean.  Instead I mean peak production relative to demand.  We passed this peak in 1973 and after the oil crisis, oil supply never continued to grow in the way it grew prior to 1973.  The crisis itself may have been political and the peak may be economic, but that doesn't make it any less real.  Since 1973, oil production has gone up and down, but never continued to grow steadily as it had in the past.<p>Oil makes our economy work because it is a cheap source of energy.  Unconventional hydrocarbons can help there, but they take much more energy to extract, and thus when energy is the limiting principle of your economy (and thus the primary cost), these are only profitable at high oil prices.  Unconventional hydrocarbons thus act as a cushion against the sort of drastic decline we might see if we were only looking at light sweet crude.  They are not a perfect substitute.  And so I predict that oil production to the extent it increases, will not do so as fast as demand, and thus energy prices will continue to rise.  The key driver of this demand is economic development in China, Brazil, India, and other countries.  And thus any increase in production will not cause a collapse in oil or energy prices.  Also note that most renewable energy has a comparatively low energy return on investment and so they are only really profitable when oil prices are high also, so they too act as a cushion.  A transition from stored solar energy (fossil fuels) to current solar energy will not be economically pleasant.<p>The problem here is that higher energy prices, particularly oil prices, puts the brakes on all aspects of the economy and the US is particularly vulnerable.  The US may already be past peak oil consumption as oil consumption has been falling off in recent years (how much is due to the Great Recession is hard to know however).<p>Retirement also affects different places differently.  Europe and the US are likely to be hardest hit by the baby boom retiring, but the US is particularly vulnerable.  In most countries in the world, retirement is not expected to be independent.  When you retire, you move in with your kids, and help them raise their kids.  They pay for your medical bills, and feed you, and you help them out as you can.  In Europe and the US this is different.  The expectation that we will have independent retirement means we have to save up vast amounts of money for that, and we also have to have programs like Medicare to provide the costs for caring for the elderly.  However, the US is uniquely bad at cost control.  Our public sector pays more per capita on medical care than any other country in the world and that's just the public sector (Medicare, Medicaid, the VA, and state/federal gov. insurance pools).  We can't control costs there and so the costs will be truly hard to bear.  Entirely missing in the health care reform debate has been this incompetence of the federal government to control costs in any way.<p>The US has one significant advantage in all this but it is one that could go away suddenly and leave us stranded.  The USD is the world's reserve currency.  This means that the national debt can be eased by the US essentially printing money to get out of debt.  However, if that changes, the US access to international credit will suddenly be very different and our debt will become difficult to sustain.  Right now we are lucky because there are no real alternatives.  The Euro was looking good for a while, but not anymore.....<p>tl; dr:  The US has a number of significant and unique challenges which will erode our presence in the world over coming decades.  How much erosion we suffer will depend on a lot of factors however.",4186660,,,0

The truth about the matter is more complicated. We're not really meaner than people of prior eras-- in fact, we've made a lot of progress as private individuals on racial/gender attitudes, even while social infrastructure has decayed-- but certain crass and mean elements of our society (casual sex, classism, internet harassment, homophobia and racism, so-called ""irony"", a heartless health insurance system) are being expressed loudly right now.<p>Although we won't, at bottom, see the economic privations of the 1930s, 2001-2009(?) will be remembered as a difficult decade during which the future of civil society seemed uncertain.

And an early stage team doesn't need a project manager, or detailed spec sheets, or other ""manager-y"" stuff.<p>I predict you'll fail with whatever you try to startup AS LONG AS you have this attitude.  A founder who used to be a former user and can point to the flaws in everything on the market and came up with a better solution is an IDEAL person to have start something.  Their intuition is based on their experience of what people like them (ie, former customers) will PAY MONEY for.  That's a business.  Hackers hacking all night is not a business.  Sorry to burst your bubble.<p>You can't be more wrong.  You only get PRACTICAL, USEFULL business ideas AS a customer/user.  That's why 99.99% of programmers who start businesses flop - they're so wrapped up in some tiny aspect of their warped reality and how their awesome code makes a tiny part of it a bit better in ways nobody understands, that they never stop and think that 99.99% of the general population of who they think will be their customers couldn't care less.<p>That's if they even bother to think about who their customers will be.  Most programmers can't think beyond ""users"" and I'm sorry, but now that we're entering recession times, you'll learn really quick that users does NOT equal same as paying customer.<p>The sad truth for you is that most successful companies were started by people without the technical skills but who were users of many things, had a ""big picture perspective"" and thought to themselves, ""You know what sucks about the current state of things, this, this and that - someone should make something different like this and this.""<p>Otherwise, from your model, you just have programmers making something most likely nobody will care about.  That's not a company, that's code.  If you get some users, that may a service, by which I mean of the charity kind.  If they pay you, that's a product, though not necessarily a successful company.<p>HERE - FORGET MY THESIS - imagine instead this scenario - let's say all the ""big idea"" people went on some Atlas shrugged type of strike.  That leaves you programmers in boston, and those in virginia, in New York, S.V, and about a hundred million others in Russia, Eastern Europe, India, China, Netherlands, Ireland, France ...<p>If the idea people are that irrelevant to starting great companies, and programmers are that all-important, why don't you guys all get together, form some sort of super development virtual company and spit out 50 million uber-companies all based on your awesome code?<p>I'll bet 50 idea people in various industries will start successful companies that MAKE MONEY for every 1 programmer with a brilliant algorithm to load YouTube videos 2% faster or whatever passes for a great business idea among hackers these days that manages to fool some desperate, inexperienced VC to put money into their project.<p>FINAL ANALYSIS: Masons build, but building without a good plan leads to well-executed crap.  No inspired architect/designer, no beauty, no inspirational ""thing"" that PAYING customers can wrap their minds around.  I've said it before and I'll say it again: just because you get ""users"" and maybe bought out by Mega-Corp. doesn't mean you've created a successful company.

Its just so incredibly obvious that this is just MegaUpload in a new form and that the entire point is to allow sharing of copyrighted data. Kim is hanging this whole thing on plausible deniability but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what's really going on. This infuriates me. Sharing copyrighted files isn't what pisses me off. What does is the arrogance of Dotcom to try to pass this thing off like its for legit sharing of files. We have Google Drive, Dropbox, Box.net, Amazon's thing, iCloud and a billion others and no one really messes with them. There's no doubt in my mind that those services are storing some copyrighted data but they don't get messed with because they're truly legit. The feds didn't go after MegaUpload because it allowed people to share files that may or may not be copyrighted. It did so because the worst kept secret on the web was that if you want to download the new Lady Gaga single you could probably find it pretty easily on MegaUpload because that's basically what everyone was using it for. I honestly have no qualms about not backing up my claims with specific examples and evidence in this case because everyone here knows what was going on at MegaUpload and anyone trying to deny is either twisting their minds into a preztel with the mental gymnastics they'd have to do to convince them otherwise or they're just outright lying. I said it.<p>So now that they have this new approach I doubt they'll be successful. Because of the way the new Mega is set up you can't search for content. Allowing the ability to search for content would necessitate getting rid of their whole privacy scheme. I predict that the new Mega could still be used to share copyrighted files but the onus will be on third parties to keep track of such files in a database or something in order to provide links to people searching or it can just become a safe place to store your copyrighted files and share them on a case by case basis (through email, links on forums, or wherever).

That was the only way to hear it more than once. So not only is there a centuries-old tradition of performing other people&#x27;s music, but there&#x27;s techniques and instruments based on that art and schools to teach you how.<p>People often did this by ear. There&#x27;s a story about Allegri&#x27;s <i>Miserere</i>, the subject of the most famous act of music piracy in history: The <i>Miserere</i> was the personal property of the Pope, and would-be copyists of the work were threatened with excommunication. For 150 years it was only performed in the Sistine Chapel during Holy Week. Then Mozart came to town at age 14, heard the piece at the Wednesday service, went back to his room and <i>wrote the whole thing down from memory</i>, came back on Friday night to listen again and make minor corrections, and gave the transcript away to be published.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miserere_(Allegri)"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Miserere_(Allegri)</a><p>It may seem obvious, but if we took any modern Mozart to see <i>Pacific Rim</i> no amount of talent would enable him to produce a reasonable cover version in a day. It would take a year and hundreds of millions of dollars. Memorizing and recopying a novel is much more achievable, but the result would not be impressive except as a stunt: It&#x27;s culturally understood that novels are intended to be printed verbatim, not reinterpreted or &quot;covered&quot;, and it would be clear to everyone that the copied version was &quot;plagiarism&quot;, not an homage or an interpretation. And many people are literally <i>blind</i> to features of a novel&#x27;s &quot;performance&quot;, such as its typesetting or the quality of its paper.<p>Novels were born in the age of cheap printing and are adapted to it. I predict that we will soon evolve genres of music that are similarly adapted to the era of cheap copying. It&#x27;s not a difficult prediction, because the selection pressure that will drive this trend is starkly obvious.<p>* It&#x27;s human nature to repeat the music that one hears. You can&#x27;t stop humming. Often even if you <i>want</i> to.<p>* There&#x27;s a tradition going back nearly a century of <i>pretending</i> that music is free: Music on the radio, and Muzak in stores. Of course, this music is all subsidized, but people don&#x27;t think about that, if they even know.<p>If I were David Lowery and someone handed me a time machine and a gun, of course I&#x27;d probably go back and shoot Hitler, like you do. But then I&#x27;d hunt down the inventor of Muzak. Because after two generations of being <i>marinated</i> in free music it&#x27;s no wonder people are habituated to think that music is free-as-in-oxygen.<p>* Pop music&#x27;s designers spent half a century promoting a culture of repeat listening, in order to encourage everyone to buy singles. So we&#x27;re trained to think of pop songs as something you <i>collect</i>, then listen to over and over. And we know that the best pop songs are the ones that are being heavily promoted, because being able to play &quot;the latest single&quot; is a fashion statement, even today.<p>Repeat-consumption of media is not some kind of natural law, it&#x27;s genre-specific. I&#x27;m a big re-reader, but I think I&#x27;m an odd case: The majority of people read books only once, which explains why, even if they do read, they don&#x27;t have a house full of books. Pauline Kael wrote about movies for a living, but never watched a movie more than once. And I have a huge Pinboard log of bookmarks, but I essentially never revisit them.<p>And, now that the money&#x27;s been sucked out of the market for &quot;original&quot; recordings by the &quot;original artists&quot;, there&#x27;s no reason why musical culture should continue to encourage playing the same thing twice. Many genres don&#x27;t: &quot;Never the same way twice&quot; pretty much <i>defines</i> jazz. (Unfortunately, jazz also evolved in an era awash with talented, classically-trained club and theater musicians, who eventually ran out of gigs because recording had been invented. The present and future of jazz is hip-hop and club music, built of improvised rhythm and rhyme instead of improvised melody and harmony, and of sampled recordings instead of sampled melodies and progressions.)",6047978,,,1

In fact, many of his arguments are largely based on economics, such as the cost to obtain a given amount of computation.  It is undeniable that this has gone down steadily with time.  Computation is so cheap that cloud computing (e.g., E2C, Azure) allows individual developers access to more computing than most know what to do with.<p>Your example of the MacBook Air is invalid because the MacBook Air of today isn't priced principally on performance -- it is priced mostly by build quality and performance/watt/kilogram.  Never before have computers had a better performance/watt/kilogram profile.  You have to consider the whole package.<p>The argument that there is less need for performance is also flawed.  It is not that humans have less need for computation, it's that the distribution of computation is changing.  As mentioned before, a lot of computation is moving to the cloud.  In many cases, this is simply the most efficient place for it to be; instead of having an abundance of computation sitting mostly unused on a laptop or desktop, computation is becoming a service where it is used on demand.  Think of the computation required for cloud services like speech to text processing or Google Goggles.  Most of the computation is farmed out the servers in cloud and only minimal.<p>I'm not even sure I agree that the decrease in local computational needs is a long term trend.  For one thing, migration to the cloud can only continue as long as network bandwidth keeps up with cloud data demands.  If network bandwidth is not able to keep up then I predict we'll see local computational needs spike again.<p>Even with some computation siphoned off to the cloud, AI will create a whole new class of applications for even local computation because it is so data intensive.  When the next crop of AI applications emerge and become more common, the early algorithms will probably be inefficient, which will itself cause a spike in computational needs.

I <i>hope</i> that I am wrong :)<p>&gt; Yes, it&#x27;s a little awkward, but to understand why this tradeoff was made, think about how you&#x27;d get the nth character in a UTF-8 string. There is a tradeoff between intuitive O(n) string indexing by characters and O(1) string indexing by bytes.<p>I understand the problem of UTF-8 character vs. byte addressing and O(n) vs. O(1) and I have thought about the problem long and hard. And I don&#x27;t claim to have a &quot;correct&quot; solution, this is a tricky tradeoff one way or the other.<p>I think that Julia &quot;does the right thing&quot; but perhaps exposes it to the programmer in a bit funny manner that is prone to runtime errors.<p>&gt; The way out that some programming languages have chosen is to store your strings as UTF-16, and use O(1) indexing by two-byte sequence.<p>Using UTF-16 is a horrible idea in many ways, it doesn&#x27;t solve the variable width encoding problem of UTF-8 but still consumes twice the memory.<p>&gt; The other way out is to store all of your strings as UTF-32&#x2F;UCS-4. I&#x27;m not sure any programming language does this, because using 4x as much memory for ASCII strings and making string manipulation significantly slower as a result (particularly for medium-sized strings that would have fit in L1 cache as UTF-8 but can&#x27;t as UCS-4) is not really a great design decision.<p>This solves the variable width encoding issue at the cost of 4x memory use. Your concern about performance and cache performance is a valid one.<p>However, I would like to see a comparison of some real world use case how this performs. There will be a performance hit, that is for sure but how big is it in practice?<p>In my opinion, the string type in a language should be targeted at short strings (long strings are some hundreds of characters, typically strings around 32 or so) and have practical operations for that. For long strings (kilobytes to megabytes) of text, another method (some kind of bytestring or &quot;text&quot; type) should be used. For a short string, a 4x memory use doesn&#x27;t sound that bad but your point about caches is still valid.<p>&gt; Instead of O(n) string indexing by characters, Julia has fast string indexing by bytes with chr2ind and nextind functions to get byte indexes by character index, and iterating over strings gives 4-byte characters. Is this the appropriate tradeoff? That depends on your taste.<p>This is <i>obviously</i> the right thing to do when you store strings in UTF-8.<p>My biggest concern is that there will be programs that crash when given non-ascii inputs. The biggest change I would have made is that str[n] should not throw a runtime error as long as n is within bounds.<p>Some options I can think of are: 1) str[n] returns n&#x27;th byte  2) str[n] returns character at n&#x27;th byte or some not-a-character value  3) Get rid of str[n] altogether and replace it with str.bytes()[n] (O(1)) and str.characters()[n] (where characters() returns some kind of lazy sequence if possible, O(n))<p>You&#x27;re right, this boils down to a matter of taste. And my <i>opinion</i> is that crashing at runtime should always be avoided if it is possible by changing the design.<p>&gt; But I don&#x27;t think that additional computer science knowledge would have made this problem any easier.<p>There is a certain difference in &quot;get things done&quot; vs. &quot;do it right&quot; mentality between people who use computers for science and computer scientists. The right way to go is not in either extreme but some kind of delicate balance between the two.",7111255,,,1

The overall approach leaves the critical question of service-specific security policy development out of scope.<p>We&#x27;ve had NSA SEL since 2000, the reason it&#x27;s rarely used is that regular people don&#x27;t have time to grok that level of detail. In response, we have things like <i>grsec</i> learning mode.<p>As with any time app-specific ACLs are brought out, the <i>real</i> question here is process, not technology. I would argue that what is really needed is not a kernel-specific solution or a protocol-specific solution (noticed how many of the new SOA infrastructure half-solutions are HTTP-only or port-level only regarding network policy?) but rather a generic, industry-wide approach toward multi-faceted security policy generation for arbitrary services including all aspects of service behavior (at both host and network levels). That in turn requires a virtualization paradigm, networking paradigm and OS neutral service devops process. This is something that we are moving towards slowly (eg. widespread <i>git</i> use, standardish build tools, containers, VLANs), but is not widely discussed.<p>We have the tools in major kernels already: syscall monitoring, relatively mature multi-subsystem security policies, network ACLs and monitoring systems, increasingly sophisticated networking virtualization solutions like Open vSwtich, filesystem-neutral monitoring. The pain in the ass is putting it all together in an average-app grokkable manner that doesn&#x27;t demand comprehension of low-level OS internals from regular developers, nitpicking application behaviour comprehension from operations infrastructure, or the employment of security nerds to reap the benefits of some of the available lower-level technologies.<p>I fear commercial offerings will never take us to this position: it&#x27;s simply not an easy sell (intangible, long term benefits vs. shorter overall timeframe and less cognitive overhead &#x2F; requisite management grok for current and familiar development processes) and too complex to implement .. in most cases requiring a complete devops process change. Instead, I predict that we will slowly see open source devops tools layer upon RCS&#x2F;VCS to provide a common continuous integration &#x2F; deployment process that integrates effective multi-subsystem application profiling for security policy development in parallel to regression tests and other pre-deployment processes.<p>Further personal thoughts on this area @ <a href=""http://stani.sh/walter/pfcts"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stani.sh&#x2F;walter&#x2F;pfcts</a>",8445419,,,3

We&#x27;ll also see completely different architectures like Chuck Moore&#x27;s greenArrays, quantum co-processors, &quot;memory&#x2F;compute fabrics&quot; like memristor crossbar arrays, and further advancements in the GPU&#x2F;APU area. These changes will continue to challenge our assumptions about what are the &quot;proper&quot; paradigms, languages, and architectures for computer programs.<p>We&#x27;ve made great progress already. I can think of myself as an example: in 2005 I, like most of the programmers here, read Herb Sutter&#x27;s essay <i>The Free Lunch Is Over</i>[1] and realized that he was correct: the era of easy speedups was giving way to the era of concurrency. And programmers were going to have to figure out how to take advantage of that concurrency or an app in 2013 was going to run at about the same speed as an app in 2005.<p>But I had <i>no idea</i> how we were going to do that. I&#x27;d used threads and mutexes and locks in my professional work so I knew that correct concurrency was hard (and correctness almost never survived past a few rounds of maintenance). But I didn&#x27;t have the first clue how we were going to get out of this mess without all becoming experts in Category Theory.<p>Fast forward to today and I find myself using things like &quot;lambda expressions&quot;, &quot;functional closures&quot;, &quot;higher order functions&quot;, &quot;map&#x2F;reduce&quot;, &quot;filters&quot;, and even &quot;monads&quot; and, you know what, they now seem as natural to me as the for-loop.<p>These days, I&#x27;m much more likely to write:<p><pre><code>    stuff.select {|l| l &gt; 23}.map(&amp;:increment_magically).sum
</code></pre>
than I am to write the equivalent imperative loop. I&#x27;m no genius, so I consider it remarkable that I&#x27;ve been able to digest these concepts as fast as I did.<p>And I am willing to bet that many other programmers here feel the same way. Not only that, but we are beginning to <i>really understand</i> things like:<p>- Identity vs value<p>- The benefits and dangers of mutable state<p>- Impure vs pure functions<p>- Software Transactional Memory<p>- MVCC &#x2F; persistent data structures<p>- Even Category Theory :)<p>None of this stuff was even remotely on my radar 8 years ago, and now it&#x27;s part of our professional lives. We may not get to <i>use</i> it all yet, but we can use more and more of it on every project.<p>And we are seeing the benefits.<p>Now fast forward to a time when we not only have hundreds or thousands of cores, but they suddenly jump up to 500 GHz.

It takes insane amounts of effort to use the basic, building blocks on complex applications without creating problems. The building blocks themselves are often simple or can be made that way. That you say the robust methods only work on the simplest stuff is actually an endorsement of my approach if we focus them on building blocks. That&#x27;s what I mainly push it for so let&#x27;s test my theory with a real-world example.<p>We&#x27;ll only use techniques from production systems made before the 80&#x27;s, that were commercially successful, and that exist today in some form. Should make it easy to argue practicality. Gives us Burroughs B5500 (1963) and IBM System&#x2F;38 (1979). Pointers are tagged for protection, actual value inaccessible by apps, and created by program loader only. Memory is tagged as code or data during load time with all input from I&#x2F;O tagged as data by default by hardware. Any input can&#x27;t be executed unless administrator explicitly allows it and it&#x27;s actually the compiler that does that anyway since apps come as source in type-safe, HLL in Burroughs model. Interfaces are checked during compilation, too. Processor checks these on every instruction. Also does bounds checking, overflow checking, type-checking of function call arguments, and stack protection. Checks and processor run in parallel for performance with final state not written unless check passes. So, you can&#x27;t smash pointers, arrays, buffers, stacks, or individual data with overflow: all just generates exceptions which are recovered from or freeze app with admin notification.<p>So, you want to hijack the app via a corrupted PDF or network packet. Assume, as you said, that the simple mechanisms above were implemented at EAL6-7 and apps just used them. Where would you start with a <i>software attack</i> (no rowhammer lol) with input to an app if you only got exceptions when hitting pointers, data fields, memory management, stacks, and arrays&#x2F;buffers? What&#x27;s left? If you&#x27;re claim is true, then these simple modifications provide no meaningful increase to the reliability or security of our systems. There&#x27;s other security risks but I&#x27;m focusing on code injection via attacking software with input. I predict attacker&#x27;s job is so difficult in this model that most would go for social engineering or sabotaging executables to attack compiler&#x2F;installer&#x2F;loader. Those are also protected by these mechanisms and ruggedly built (eg Ada or SPARK w&#x2F; all checks on). You&#x27;re actually more knowledgeable and skilled than me at the many implementation attack methods. How many are left at this point? Seriously, so I can counter them too.<p>Funny you mentioned hardware. It certainly does have errata here and there. Yet, that&#x27;s despite tens of millions to billions of transistors running concurrently. Its error rate is actually incredible. I wonder why. Let&#x27;s look at design flow for Intel, IBM, etc.: specs to RTL to gates with equivalence checking at each layer; lots of testing; formal verification (Intel) and falsification (IBM) of stuff at various layers; synthesis tools with validation approaches to that; generic components with interfaces and timing analysis; gate-level testing to see where tools were lying; comparisons of instrumented chip to the models after a fab run. The difficulties were overcome by constantly investing in tools for various problems and heuristics that made them work better. Guess what? Those methods look very similar to the B3, A1, EAL6, and other assurance activities. They also <i>worked</i>: quality in terms of errata varied from staying steady to improving over time despite exponential increases in complexity.<p>Believe it or not, you don&#x27;t need to verify a whole system at highest levels. I&#x27;m not even promising absolute security from the effort: just saying systems designed this way have had incredible resilience to pentests, faults, and external attacks. I say invest the effort into mechanisms like above, languages immune to what we can, analysis tools catching what we can, compilers, most-used parts of kernels, interfaces (esp glue), parsers, and so on. These have already been built rather than theory: really just re-applying existing work to new system. Less than 1% of code and design done right knocks out 99% of routes for code-injection and many other issues in the rest of the system. The rest we catch with security research and reviews. Or recover from after monitoring detects problems.<p>So, Thomas, would you trust an x86-style processor with a monolithic kernel coded in C? Or a system like EROS running on my above CPU that only uses safe mechanisms (hardware-enforced), safe languages, and robust tools for making one properly use the other? Even if COTS-style implementation, the amount of vulnerabilities and their severity should nose dive. Your current position is that 400 kernel and thousands of user-level vulnerabilities resulting in malware execution are better than thousands of user-mode exceptions, a few kernel-exceptions, and maybe a few injects from what we didn&#x27;t see coming. I disagree and think we can do better. Friggin 1960&#x27;s-1970&#x27;s tech had better security &amp; reliability than current architectures! Academics (see crash-safe.org or CHERI) have with way less time and money than Intel, IBM, etc. So, why do you speculate? Methods that got results against problems before will get results against same kinds of problems again. Just need to <i>apply them</i> and in most cost-effective way. All I preach.",9955820,,,0

Lets look at why...<p>The iPhone is a computer. A pretty one, that can run lots of shiny, pretty apps covered in gradients. When people see it, they are immediately aware of how hip the person wielding it is. Apple took everything great about their desktop computers (pretty, fashionable, stable, simple) and condensed them all into a small, even more fashionable, even more convenient, simple package called an iBook. Coffee shop dwellers wielding an iBook could let their fellow caffeine-solution enjoyers just how hip they were, just how PRODUCTIVE they were with their wonderful macbooks.<p>Then came the iPhone. Apple took all the wonderful things about their desktops (stability, simplicity, etc.) plus all the wonderful things about their notebooks (simple, fashionable) and combined them into a wonderful even MORE portable packaged called an iPhone. This iPhone could be carried in its owner's pocket. The look-at-me oppurtunities were endless. People could admire the superior technical prowess (complete with white apple logo displayed in stark contrast the black case on the back of the thing) of iPhone users on the train, or on the bus, or on the sidewalk, or in a coffee shop, or the office, or in the kitchen, at a restaurant...ANYWHERE!<p>A tablet, however...what does this supposedly offer that the iPhone doesn't? It isn't as mobile, meaning less oppurtunites for look-at-me, it would likely run Mac OSX or some derivative of it.. meaning a hefty tax to the apple gods...it would undoubtedly be covered in ultra-high-gloss plastic, meaning that any hopes of replacing something like a panasonic toughbook would be seriously mis-guided.<p>The only market that apple has not yet tried to dominate, and that it is in any sort of position to even enter, is netbooks.<p>They had a sort-of false-start called the MacBook Air, something that I think everybody would agree is an example of just how much of a failure apple can produce.<p>The next itteration of the iPhone is, most certainly, a netbook. The question is whether or not apple is willing to forfeit its position as a luxury item in exchange for increased penetration. A sub-300-dollar netbook is something that is likely NOT in apple's future.<p>Apple has got something really great going for them right now. People WANT an apple. Macs are seen as something that is, in some way, better than their windows-based counterparts. Even Microsoft seems to be willing to admit this in their latest ads.<p>In conclusion, apple will NOT be creating a tablet; it simply does not follow with the current trend of their products. If anything, they will produce a $500 netbook that is still seen as ""better"" than its competitors. If this happens, I predict low market penetration and ultimate failure.",724520,,,6

Right now, people don’t seem to care about privacy all that much, and I can't blame them.
Every time the privacy debate comes up in relation to google or facebook the conversation is steered towards the following assumptions:<p><pre><code>  - The attacker is another member of the website or an anonymous web user.
  - The platform (gmail or facebook) is a trusted third party.
</code></pre>
This is not the debate I want to be having. I don't agree with the second assumption. Any “privacy policy” I can fill out for my data will not prevent the company from accessing my data. They own the database and the file servers and even have authority over my login credentials for that website.<p>What about the privacy in the following paradigm:<p><pre><code>   - The attacker can be any person or company on the internet.
   - Your server is a VM in a distributed platform of hosts.
   - You have a special credential (id-rsa), which is used to change settings on the VM.  
   - Host can be trusted most of the time, but sometimes (prob=0.2) they are malicious.

</code></pre>
If we ensure there is a big ecosystem of hosting companies with a compatible API, then individual users could constantly migrate their hosting plans and change companies every month, or even every week. Thus in the worst case, a ""cloud host"" could eavesdrop on you just for one week. If you constantly change hosts, you will get a guaranteed 80% privacy, which is much better than 0% privacy.<p>Anyone who has lots of servers on their hands and wants to start a hosting company -- I say you get the whole ""my home in the cloud"" app hosting business started:

They enjoy a brief period in which their income is essentially automated.<p>Phase 3: Companies use the service as a lawyer, lawyers only used in extraordinary circumstances.<p>A big part of the lawyer&#x27;s value proposition is about liability&#x2F;peace of mind. Like, &quot;I&#x27;m sure this NDA is solid because if it&#x27;s not I have someone to sue, the guy who wrote it, my lawyer.&quot; That&#x27;s a valuable service, which is why they will stay in the picture during phase 3--essentially a liability limiting sign off.<p>Im sure you&#x27;ve thought about that, as your business model sort of hinges on having the lawyer take all the liability. Ie, the documents you provide are just &quot;suggestions&quot; or boilerplate for a professional to base their work off of, and those professionals are the ones who are actually liable for mistakes or oversights. It makes sense.<p>(Sidenote: I predict some hostility from lawyers here, similar to the hostility in the design profession over stuff like 99designs. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll matter though. They will be hostile because they know that the tool, if it becomes widespread, would drastically reduce the number of lawyers who can work in the area, but they will each be incentivized to use the tools individually because it&#x27;ll save them time in their practice as they all race for the bottom, hoping that they are one of the few left standing in the aftermath.)<p>Anyway, you&#x27;ll have access to a very large dataset of those potential mistakes and oversights plus the tactics that work to solve them, and you&#x27;ll be able to hone the tool so that they become more and more rare (this is phase 2 from above).<p>But the thing I wonder about is what the second order effects will be. Let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re in a world in which Ironclad has won, and millions of businesses use it for the legal needs.<p>In that world you have drastically fewer lawyers handling more clients because the work is essentially automated and they are sign signing off. Each lawyer probably still makes the same money overall since the revenue per client is much lower.<p>At some point something will go wrong, and the lawyer will be on the hook for having screwed up. And he&#x27;ll say &quot;Wait a minute, I&#x27;m not the one who screwed up. I used the Microsoft of legal services, the one you can&#x27;t get fired for choosing, the huge goliath that lowly me could never hope to question because they have the most legal expertise in the world. I used Ironclad. They said this document was right, who am I to say otherwise? I trusted them, and they are the ones who screwed up.&quot;<p>And at first it won&#x27;t matter. That&#x27;s not how professional liability works, so that lawyer will get ground up in the gears. Maybe the scrappy ones will sue you, and you&#x27;ll take your knocks, mostly winning or settling.<p>But I wonder if maybe when there&#x27;s an army of rubber stampers who are essentially not doing anything except saying &quot;If Ironclad screwed up this document, then I&#x27;ll take the fall,&quot; then with enough case law the environment will change, and somehow Ironclad actually would be saddled with a greater proportion of the liability? Normally I imagine things like that wouldn&#x27;t work because no one will fight enough to place the liability where it probably belongs, but in this case you&#x27;ll be up against LAWYERS, whose profession it is to deal with and fight for&#x2F;against laws. That might make a difference in the very long term.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;d be a good problem to have since it would mean you won like 20 years ago. Good luck guys, I think it&#x27;ll be big!",9977259,,,12

Focusing on where you're being screwed keeps you being screwed.<p>In the last 20 years, Linux has taken over many domains. First servers. The big win that made Linux impossible to ignore. Ten years later a major shift to the userland was mobile: there are half a billion Android devices sold. Not to mention embedded systems. Meanwhile, Linux has also become <i>the way to build supercomputers</i>: the world's fastest supercomputers these days mean assembling huge Tesla GPU racks to run Linux.<p>While I do realize that secure boot can make Linux's life harder, I also realize that Linux per se isn't going anywhere or isn't attacked by Microsoft but general purpose computers are suffering from exhausted momentum. There are more and more devices that come with a preinstalled system, such as Android and iOS and the traditional desktop/laptop paradigm of buying hardware and installing whatever you want to run on it will continue to move into the marginal.<p>I predict that eventually it's the programmers who will be the only ones who exercise tasks of so varying nature that they need a more complex interface, something like what I'm using now. Most of the rest of people can manage with mostly touching a screen to use applications that offer a set of predefined capabilities, occasionally hooking up a keyboard.<p>The era of immutable operating systems with applications installable from a prefiltered app store is probably what actually works for most people. It's us programmers who long for the days when hardware was to be bought and software was to be written because we know that the lowest layer must always be there. For us, it was the very definition of a computer: programming hardware was all there ever was to computers. But most people don't need that.<p>Most people are perfectly <i>happy with an appliance</i>. They don't want to install updates or <i>manage their system</i>, they just click the power button and immediately continue from where they left the last time. They want an application and they tap it and it gets installed without clicking through a dozen pages of a helper wizard or aptitude install commands. And appliances such as tablets and phones and touchscreen laptops deliver a much better experience for non-programmers.<p>What we as programmers see as a bad thing is that programming will be removed farther from the end users. We all know how we started with playing games and ended up writing our own games because our computers allowed, and to an extent, suggested that. We would want to preserve that heritage to the future whizkids and future programmers. But that's still got a perspective bias: most people so far still haven't ""found it"" even if their computer would have allowed it. It's just us for which ""finding it"" was the revelation, and we know we would've ""found it"" anyway, somehow.<p>Maybe they'll be selling a limited stock of programmer's computers in ten years that are fully programmable. There's definitely a market for those because you can't write the nice appliances without a real programmers' computer. Maybe my grandkids will receive one of my old programmer's workstations from my work place, and use that deprecated hardware to teach themselves programming and find it a thousand times more interesting than playing games on their phones, much like my predecessors managed to hook themselves up with cheap nighttime computing time in a mainframe at their father's workplace and abused those cycles to write games to entertain themselves.",4876789,,,0

Beginning Full Rate Production in 2018 is set to make a large drop in cost for the same reasons anything in mass-production costs less as well.<p>&gt;The saving grace for the F-35 is that US has many political and economic tools it can use to convince partner nations to continue with the program.

It was to counter the assertion that desalination is impractical because it necessarily increases them.  The scope of this discussion was limited to addressing that assertion, not to list ways to reduce CO2 emissions in general.<p>Rainwater collection is not a substitute for desalination because in many years there is little or no rain.  The author&#x27;s principal position is that there is no drought because once every 10 or 20 years there is (or was) a wet one; of course, to conclude this he includes the extremely wet 2004 and excludes the extremely dry 2013-2015.  Even if we ignore his cherry-picking, that position is not a sensible one; it is equivalent to asserting that with an infinitely large reservoir, California would always have enough water regardless of the consumption rate.  The reality is that consumption exceeds the long-term average supply by a considerable margin and has increased due to population growth even as the likely future supply is shrinking.  Furthermore, large quantities of water cannot be stored forever; it evaporates, seeps into the ground, or both.  The wet years, rare even in the past and likely to be moreso in the future, don&#x27;t come often enough to keep reservoirs full.  There&#x27;s also the problem of the inland cities, where even historical average rainfall is far below 14 inches a year, which the author conveniently ignores.<p>Rainwater collection and recycling of treated sewage are therefore necessary but insufficient measures (at least in southern and inland California; they&#x27;re probably sufficient for places like Eureka).  In addition to those measures, additional sources will have to be found and&#x2F;or large-scale reductions in consumption will be required.  Desalination is perhaps the only plausible means of increasing supply (all Western river systems are already critically oversubscribed), and while it is costly, it does come without the political problems of forcibly reducing consumption.  As such, I predict that solar-powered desalination will eventually become the central piece of the state&#x27;s response to its water shortage.  It does a good job of matching plentiful resources (solar energy, ocean water) to visible needs (more water for coastal cities).  It does not address the needs of agriculture, but nothing can.

Despite having attended college, many people end up working retail or otherwise low-wage jobs. After hearing that you&#x27;re supposed to &quot;follow your dreams&quot; and that all you really need to do is &quot;believe in yourself and you can accomplish anything,&quot; it&#x27;s not unreasonable to imagine why this generation feels left behind or alienated.

If you're trying to use this as an example of a flaw in anything, it would be the computer industry for not figuring out artificial intelligence, not the mathematics community. So, <i>if</i> this was the author's intention, then I think it's flawed right from the outset, but I don't think this was truly the author's intent. (For one thing, Curry-Howard correspondence is talking about lambda calculus, not what you think when you hear ""computer"" today.)<p>Really, the article's entire premise is predicated on <i>extreme</i> misunderstandings of Godel. For instance:<p>&#62; In fact, Gödel's 1931 Second Incompleteness Theorem insists that it is strictly forbidden to ever claim the truth of any scientific or mathematical statement:<p>What? Where does it say that? It says (quoting the article here):<p>&#62; For any formal effectively generated theory T including basic arithmetical truths and also certain truths about formal provability, if T includes a statement of its own consistency then T is inconsistent.<p>If a theory includes a statement of its own consistency, then that theory is inconsistent. How does that imply that it is ""strictly forbidden to ever claim the truth of any scientific or mathematical statement""? The honest answer is that it doesn't, not in the slightest. When it comes to mathematics, we're not saying the axioms are consistent, we're saying statements <i>within this set of axioms</i> are true. Are the axiomizations true? I don't know, but <i>a lot</i> of work has gone into these theories and so far they look pretty good. But at any rate, the author uses this theorem in a completely incorrect manner. He is right that we don't know if any of the various mathematical foundations are consistent, true, but as I said, so far everything looks pretty good.<p>Then he throws this bombshell:<p>&#62; Given Gödel's First Incompleteness we already know that for any claim making use of basic arithmetic, counterexamples must exist.<p>What? How? Here's Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem, per Wikipedia:<p>&#62; Any effectively generated theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both consistent and complete. In particular, for any consistent, effectively generated formal theory that proves certain basic arithmetic truths, there is an arithmetical statement that is true, but not provable in the theory (Kleene 1967, p. 250)<p>How in the world does that say that ""for any claim making use of basic arithmetic, counterexamples must exist."" (Counterexamples of what, anyway? Basic arithmetic?) Actually, what the theorem says that you can't have a theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic that is <i>both</i> consistent and complete. The <i>both</i> is the huge part. So far, for example, we think ZFC is consistent. We <i>know</i> it is not complete; see this: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statements_undecidable_in_ZFC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statements_undecidable_...</a> . So, the idea that there ""must exist counterexamples"" (of what, I don't know) as per Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem is simply ridiculous. As a result, we don't know that there are ""simply bugs"" in the ""successor function."" As a result, the idea that ""all basic claims are more or less false"" is completely shot down. Needs better proof.<p>&#62; The claim above is not Popper-compliant.<p>Why not? It's falsifiable, so it is. (If it were false, you would need simply to provide an extremely small epsilon and ask for the correspondingly large delta.) It gives the ""appearance"" of truth because it is indeed true -- relative to the axioms under which it was proven. The author also seems to conflate inductive and deductive disciplines. In mathematics, we create axioms and follow them through to some meaning. In the vast majority of the sciences, the process is very much inductive. So, this seeming focus on making everything mathematical ""scientific"" is pretty flawed in and of itself. How can you reason about mathematics if you don't have some way to check your results? In the sciences, if I predict gravity will disappear in five minutes for thirty seconds, that is a very testable claim (and a false one, most likely, based on our past experimentation). How can I disprove or prove something in mathematics? Well, we created all these wonderful axioms and they seem consistent (although incomplete, of course), so I can use them to check my results. A little PHP script is not going to cut it. For one thing, the author's script's notion of ""division"" is predicated on the very idea of division. Where did that come from? For another, the script is not a proof at all. It's just a program to test some values. It doesn't <i>prove</i> anything at all. It's just further evidence towards the proof of something we already know is true.<p>In sum: the article is bullshit. It misinterprets Godel in terrible ways. For all the fancy French and Latin, it doesn't even provide a programmatic proof of its own claims, the supposed holy grail, after all! The only program it provides is a little test, not anything near a proof. I think if you actually try to provide ""Popper-compliant"" statements and write programs to prove everything, you end up reverting to all of the normal contemporary mathematical language anyway. I mean, look at this:<p>&#62; In order to reject this claim, find a number almostZero for which it will not be possible to find a large enough number x for which 1/x is smaller than almostZero.<p>That sentence is essentially a rewording of an old-fashioned delta-epsilon proof. So, how does that indicate a flaw in contemporary mathematics at all? Why should we stop teaching our kids these ""symbols"" since they are apparently still so very convenient for reasoning about mathematics? The truth is that there's no reason to. The ""executable claims"" are only found after all of the ""verbiage"" is said and done.",4956000,,,0

But my point is a simple one and it&#x27;s something that you can test out yourself: try comparing a half dozen academic history article written in, say, 1950, to a half dozen from 2015. I predict that, on average, a 2015 article will feature a far more robust evidence base, a broader range of sources, a richer historiography, and more rigorous language training than its counterpart from the 1940s, 50s or 60s. In my experience there is simply no comparison. In part this is because digitized texts make it so much easier to access a wide range of sources, but it also has to do with an increase in standards of graduate education. Getting a PhD in a field like history used to be an old boys club based on connections and family money. It certainly still retains some of those trappings today, but I think there can be no question that academic training today is far more rigorous (and entering graduate school or getting an article accepted more competitive) than it was in decades past.<p>I don&#x27;t really take issue with the comments about students and multiple choice exams, though.

I predict that adding the class keyword, while saving me some time will also cause an uptick to unnecessarily convoluted inheritance patterns as new users find they can implement all of their design patterns verbatim without thinking if they really need the ajax method, the json parser, and the url builder to all be in objects that inherit from each other.",8873225,,,10
