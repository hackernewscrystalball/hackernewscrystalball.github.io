    "prediction": "I predict that the Federal Reserve will gain new powers within the next quarter that will enable them to indefinitely prop up equity markets through large-scale asset purchases in the equity markets through some novel facility (I'm sure it'll have some super cool new vernacular as well) that changes all the rules and allows for unilateral action without any covenants - awesome!For any speculators out there - just buy calls, nothing can go down anymore.",
