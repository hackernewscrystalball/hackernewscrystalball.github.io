    "prediction": "I predict there will come a \"UV-C Provenance\" protocol where:1) the genuine UV-C LED chip manufacturer keeps a cadastre of ownership of UV-C LED's2) resellers or product manufacturers must contact the original chip manufacturer with the buyer's email to transfer ownership of a number of contained LED's when selling3) original UV-C LED manufacturers must contact the buyer to ask for confirmation of receipt of the UV-C LED (or the product that contained such a number of LED's)4) resellers or product manufacturers may not use the \"UV-C provenance\" logo if the product does not actually use UV-C LEDs, if they can not prove the provenance by referencing unsold LED's in their name with the chip manufacturer, or if they don't perform their roles above5) governments perform regular randomized trials of buying \"UV-C LED\" branded products, and measure the wavelength to verify truthfulness, with hefty fines for violationsOne might think that a product designer could order genuine UV-C LED's, not use them, order UV-A LED's to use in the product, sell as if they were UV-C, and then afterwards sell their genuine stock.",
