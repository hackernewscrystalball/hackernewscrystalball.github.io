    "prediction": "I predict that this trend towards requiring companies to include information in job postings that leaves them in a legal grey area (what if I end up hiring someone and paying above the range? can I be sued for discrimination by a unrepresented minority if the unrepesented minority gets an offer on the low end? what if I don't find anyone that is near the top of the range? can I be sued for that too? what if my current staff isn't in the salary range?) is just going to result in less public job postings and more use of recruiters and good-old-boy networks.",
