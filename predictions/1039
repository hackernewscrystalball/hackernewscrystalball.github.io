    "prediction": "I predict that in the next year the Q will get software support for:- iOS devices as a controller- other computers on your network as a controller (web interface or chrome app or something)- netflix/hulu/other stuff streaming support- music/video streaming from local network devices- streaming all audio output from a device (like my desktop computer) to the Q, so it can be used as a stereo device instead of just an output deviceHowever, assuming all of those features were added, I'm still not sure I'd pay $300 for it.",
