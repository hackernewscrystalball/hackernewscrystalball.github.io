    "prediction": "I predict that the tech industry will go the wrong direction with AI, in roughly this order: industry invests heavily in cybersecurity and profit-driven artificial intelligence research to better exploit users by leveraging their shopping addictions, social/mobile bubble pops as independent developers are undermined further by receiving an ever-smaller slice of the pie, a global recession rivaling the dotcom crash and housing bubble pop hits which halts progress in social causes similarly to what happened during the lost decade of the 2000s, the US doubles down on trying every wrong thing before being forced to do the right thing (further tax cuts for the wealthy, privatization of remaining government services, no UBI because there is no money for that, further regression into service industry feudalism), sometime between 2025 and 2030 the world comes out of recession but now all money passes through an online gatekeeper (whatever follows Amazon) as the world transitions from sovereign nations to having its monetary policy determined by corporations, Stockholm syndrome far exceeding the Trump phenomenom grips the world in luddite-inspired rejection of magic technologies like AI, climate change falls from the forefront of concerns as simple human incursion into every last wild place on Earth creates an instability in civilization due to having so many insurrection cells crossing national boundaries that civic discourse gives way to political infighting and canabalistic government policy, a third world war or dystopian new world order or singularity hit all at about the same time between 2040 and 2050 so that only the rich and powerful have oracle-level AI technology and live in gated communities while the world burns, the masses find that they still need food in VR and then rise up and something happens which unfortunately can't really be predicted past this point.",
